Wh ile there are benefits in outsourcing such \nservices, the processes of c ontract letting and monitoring of service deliverables are \nprone to corrupt practices, causing financial loss to the organizations or companies and \ndamages to their reputation. \nThis Best Practice Checklist (BPC) aims to provide organi zations and companies with \na user-friendly guide on the procedures and safeguards to prevent malpractice in the \nletting and administration of cleaning and s ecurity contracts, c overing invitation of \ntenders, selection of contractors, award of  contracts, and monitoring of service \nstandards. Users of the BPC are advised to adapt the recommended measures to suit their \nrespective organizational structure, resource  capability, operational needs, and risk \nexposures. \nThe Advisory Services Group of the Co rruption Prevention Department of ICAC \nstands ready to provide free, confiden tial, and tailor-made corruption prevention \nadvice to private compani es on request, including how to apply the practices \nrecommended in this BPC.

The approving authority should \nbe at the senior management level. \n• Restrictive tendering or quotation – Procure \nservices below a specified amount by inviting a specified number of contractors sourced from an \napproved list or the market ( 2.3). The level of \napproving authority should be determined by the value of purchases (usually restrictive tendering for purchases of higher value and quotation for \npurchases of lower value). \nDetermine whether a two-enve lope system is necessary \n(i.e. for high value purchases where price is not the only consideration, contractors are required to submit \nservice and price proposal\ns in separately sealed \nenvelopes for assessment). \nRequire all staff involved in the procurement process to \ndeclare any perceived or actua l conflict of interest (e.g. \na staff m\nember responsible for evaluating tenders has \nfinancial interest in the business (e.g. holding shares) of \na tenderer) and, in case of declared conflict, take steps \nto remove the conflict by  assigning another staff \nmember to take over the job or  requiring a supervisor to \nclosely monitor the process. \nInstruct all staff involved in the process to avoid \nover-socialising with or accepting excessive or lavish \nentertainment from the contractors. \nRequire all staff to keep sensitive information obtained  \nin the procurement process confidential. \n2 \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n  \n Segregate duties, as far as practicable, by assigning \ndifferent staff members to take charge of different \nprocesses, such as sourcing contractors ( 2.3), \npreparing service co\nntract agreements ( 2.10) and \nm\nonitoring service deliverables ( 2.11). \nRegularly review the policies and guidelines for \nprocurement to ensure they are up to date. \n2.2 Purchase Requests and Specifications of Service \nUser Identify the need for cleani ng or security service, \nand draw up the scope of service required, using a \nPurchase \n Requisition  Form (sample  at \nAppendix 1 ). \nSubmit the Purchase Requisition Form to the \napproving authority for endorsement. \nApproving Ascertain the need for th e service requested and \nAuthority check the budget before approval. \nUser/ Prepare an invitation for quot ations or tenders (i.e. \nProcurement a tender/quotation document) which should contain \nStaff the following service specifications, seeking \ntechnical input or legal advice as necessary: \nBackground information of bidders, such as \nsize of company, years of previous experience in similar contracts, client reference if any, \netc. (for the purpose of shortlisting or \npre-qualifying bidders). \nSpecification of service requirements and \nstandard of service, for example: \nFor cleaning contracts – coverage of service, frequency of cleaning or refuse collection, \nnumber of cleaning workers and supervisors, \nsupervision plans, records of service, response time to requests for urgent cleaning tasks, etc. \n3 \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n For security contracts – security coverage (e.g. 24 hours) and number of guard posts, \nfrequency of patrols, number of security \nguards and supervisor s, equipment (e.g. \nelectronic probing devices for patrols), \nresponse time to requests for additional \nservice, a supervision plan and records of \nservice, etc. \nContract terms and conditions (e.g. contract \nperiod, payment cond itions, third party \ninsurance, contract termination provisions). \nA warning against bribery and collusion in \nbidding. \nPayment methods (e.g. monthly payments) and \nrates for additional or variation of services (if \npayments and rates are to be proposed by the \nbidders for assessment, this should be stated in \nthe invitation document). \nThe selection criteria and their respective \nweightings in the assessment of tenders or quotations, if price is not the only consideration. \nManagement Appoint a panel of staff to vet and approve the \ntender documents (incl uding the assessment \ncriteria) and, if price is not the only consideration, \nto assess the proposals. \n2.3 Sourcing of Contractors \nProcurement \nStaff Maintaining Approved Contractors Lists \nMaintain a list of contractors approved by the \nmanagement or a designated panel, if exercises for \ncontracting out cleaning and security services are \nfrequently conducted. \n4 \n   \n  \n  \n  \n   \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n                                                \n Ensure that the approved lis t contains an adequate \nnumber of contractors to enhance competitiveness. \nEstablish a procedure for inviting openly contractors \nto apply for listing from time to time. \nLay down the criteria and procedures for listing and \ndelisting, and make them known to all contractors \n(e.g. on the website). \nVet all applications for lis ting against the criteria, \nincluding those nominated by in-house staff or \nusers. \nRegularly review the approved list, with a view to \nremoving contractors w ith poor performance or \nthose who are inactive. \nShortlisting Contractors for Ad Hoc \nContract-Letting2 \nSource contractors through nominations by users, \nreferences provided by bu siness partners, company \nwebsites, and inclusion of those who have \napproached the company/orga nization in the past to \nindicate interest in the contracts. \nShortlist contractors according to the pre-determined \ncriteria and seek approval of the proposed shortlist \nfrom the designated authority (e.g. a panel or a \nsenior staff member). \nEnsure that the shortlist contains an adequate \nnumber of contractors to enhance competitiveness. \n2.4 Invitation of Quotations \nWhere bidders are selected from an approved list, \nensure that the listed contractors are invited to bid \non a fair share basis (e.g. by rotation) and justify in \nwriting any out of turn invitation or frequent invitation of the same few contractors to bid. Procurement Staff \nProcurement \nStaff \n2 This method of sourcing contractors is applicable to organizations/companies which procure \ncleaning and security services on an ad hoc basi s and do not have an approved list of contractors. \n5 \n  \n \n \n  \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n   \n \n \n  Invite the required numbe r of contractors on the \napproved list or all contractors on the shortlist (for \nad hoc purchases) ( 2.3) to submit quotations \n(sample quotation invitation document at \nAppendix 2 ). \nInvite additional contractors nom inated by users or \nother staf\nf to bid only if they meet the listing criteria \nand they should not replace those selected from the approved list or already on the shortlist. \nEnsure all bidders are given the same information \nwhich is essential for quotation preparation. \nSpecify the mode of submission of quotations (e.g. \nby fax or email for quotations), and the deadline for \nsubmission. \n2.5 Invitation of Tenders \nOpenly invite tenders through the website or \nnewspaper advertisements  (i.e. open tendering); \nor \nInvite the required numbe r of contractors on the \napproved list or the shortlist to tender (i.e. restrictive \ntendering) ( 2.3). \nWhere tend\nerers are select ed from an approved list, \nensure that the listed contractors are invited to bid \non a fair share basis (e.g. by rotation) and justify in \nwriting any out of turn invitation or frequent invitation of the same few contractors to bid. \nInvite additional contractors nominated by users or other staff to bid only if they meet the listing criteria and they should not replace those selected \nfrom the approved list or already on the shortlist. Procurement \nStaff \n6 \n  \n \n  \n  \n \n  \n   \n   \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Specify the mode of submission of tenders, e.g. by \nfax, through an electronic tendering system if there \nis one, or by hand ( 2.6), and the deadline for \nsubmission. \nIssue \n a tender invitation letter (sample at \nAppendix 3 ) and include the essential \ninformation in the tender invitation documents \n( 2.2). \nEnsure all tenderers are given the same inform\nation \nwhich is essential for tender preparation. \nConsider arranging a briefing and a site visit for all \ninterested tenderers if appropriate. \nConsider using a two-envelo pe approach if price is \nnot the only consideration, i.e. require the service and price proposals to be submitted in separately \nsealed envelopes to ensure the service proposals could be assessed separate ly and objectively before \nopening the price offers. \nRequire tenderers to subm it tender proposals in \nduplicate (one for assessmen t and one as a master \ncopy for audit or checking if necessary). \n2.6 Receipt and Opening of Quotations/Tenders \nManagement Lay down the procedures w ith safeguards to prevent \ntampering of quotations or tenders, for example: \nUse a designated fax mach ine kept in a secure \nplace with restricted acc ess, or an electronic \nsystem with access cont rol (and access time bar \nbefore the closing time) to receive quotations or tenders. \n7 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n  \n  \n \n  Procurement Staff Place the tenders/quotations received by fax or \nemail in the safe custody of a staff member not involved in the process or deposit them in the tender box as soon as they are received. \nTo receive tenders submitted by hand, use a \ntender box with double lock (the two keys to be kept by different persons to enhance checks and balances). \nAssign a team comprising at least two staff \nmembers to open the quotations/tenders shortly after the closing time and prohibit opening of \nbids before the deadline. \nKeep proper records of all quotations and tenders received and opened for future audit \n(sample  \nquotation/tende r opening  record at \nAppendix 4 ) (e.g. the quotation/tender opening \nrecord or duplicate copies of tenders to be kept by a designated staff member not involved in the \nprocess). \nReject late submissions after the closing time unless with the approval of the designated authority on \njustifiable grounds (e.g. only one or insufficient number of tenders received). \n2.7 Evaluation of Quotations \nProcurement \nStaff / User Check compliance with the quotation requirements and mandatory contract conditions. \nSelect a compliant bid with the best price offer, or \nevaluate the quotations based on the selection \ncriteria if price is not the only consideration. \nRecommend the selected contractor on the Purchase \nRequisition Form, attaching all the quotations received, for endorsement by the approving \nauthority. \nGive justifications if the best price offer is not \nrecommended. \n8 \n \n \n \n  \n  \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  2.8 Evaluation of Tenders \nManagement Appoint an evaluation panel, comprising the user \nand the procurement staff to evaluate the tenders if the quality of service is taken into account apart \nfrom the price. \nRemind the panel members to declare conflict of \ninterest. \nTender Pre-determine the tender evaluation criteria, their \nEvaluation relative weightings based on the tender \nPanel requirements, and the marking scheme before  tender \ninvitation to ensure all a ssessment criteria and the \nweightings are made known to the bidders as this would help enhance fairness and transparency. \nDo not modify the evaluation criteria and the weightings after the tenders  are opened as this will \nlead to allegation of unfairness and manipulation. \nDesign a tender evaluation fo rm for use and require \npanel members to make assessment on their own before any discussion or calculation of the total marks for each tender to enhance fairness and \nobjectivity (sample at \nAppendix 5 ). \nCheck compliance with the mandatory requirements \nstipulated in the tender specification and contract \nconditions before assessment. \nIf a two-envelope approach is used, open the price \noffers only after the serv ice proposals have been \nassessed. \nInvite the bidders to give a presentation to the panel if necessary, and make sure  the opportunity is given \nto all bidders for the sake of fairness. \nSelect the one with the best offer, i.e. the best price \noffer (if price is the only consideration) or the offer with the highest score (if two-envelope approach is \nused), and give reasons if this is not the case. \n9 \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n  \n  \n \n \n  \n \n Procurement \nStaff Submit a tender evaluation report  \n (sample  at \nAppendix 6 ), recommending the best offer, or \nthe conduct of negotiation with the tenderer/tenderers submitting the best offer/offers \n( 2.9), for endorsement by the approving \nauthorit\ny. \nNotify the selected tenderer and inform the \nunsuccessful tenderers of th e tender result in writing \n(sample letters at Appendix 7 ). \n2.9 Post-Tender Negotiation \nManagement Lay down the guidelines for post-tender negotiation, including: \nthe criteria for selecting tenderers for negotiation \n(e.g. the highest-scorer or the top three highest-scoring bidders); \nthe baseline price and conditions, beyond which \nthe negotiating staff should be required to seek \ninstruction from the management; prohibition on disclosure of the tenderers’ bids before, during \nor after the negotiation; and \nrequirement for the bidders to submit the “best \nand final” offer in wr iting after negotiation. \nAppoint a negotiation team comprising at least two persons of the appropriate level to conduct negotiation for high value contracts. \nNegotiation Conduct negotiation within the defined parameters \nTeam and seek instruction from the management as necessary. \nDocument the salient points of negotiation and the \nresult. \n10 \n  \n \n \n   \n \n  \n \n  \n  \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n  \n  \n  \n \n \n \n  \n Tender \nEvaluation Panel \nApproving \nAuthority Evaluate the “best and final” offers and submit a recommendation in writing to the approving authority. \nEnsure the recommendation is made according to \nthe laid down selection criteria. \nConsider the need for re-tendering if the original \ntender requirements have been substantially changed after negotiation to avoid allegation of \nunfairness to the unsuccessful bidders. \n2.10 Award of Service Contracts \nUser / Based on the requirements stipulated in the \nProcurement quotation/tender documents, include in the contract \nStaff / agreement the following terms and conditions and \nManagement seek legal advice as necessary: \nservice requirements and \n standards of service \n( 2.2); \nthe contract period (i.e. dates of contract \ncommencement and expiry); \nrequirements for the contractors to submit daily \nreturns on the workers’ attendance (for the \ncalculation of payments if the number of \nworkers is pledged as a contract deliverable) and keep work records for checking; \nsanctions against sub-standard performance (e.g. provisions for deduction of payment in case of any short delivery of the service \npledged); \npayment terms, including  the schedule of rates \n(e.g. monthly, daily a nd hourly) and any special \nrates for urgent or additional services; \n11 \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n  \n   documents required for claims of payment (e.g. attendance records and invoices); \nprovisions for contract variations (e.g. additional or urgent service); \nprohibition on sub-contracting; and \ninsurance policies. \nInclude in the contract c onditions a probity clause \nprohibiting the contractors and their staff from acceptance, offer or solicitation of bribes when performing duties under the contract. \n2.11 Monitoring of Performance \nManagement Appoint staff members of the appropriate rank to monitor the standard of service delivered by the contractors. \nDesign a performance eval uation checklist (sample \nat Appendix 8 ) for use or establish a system to \nrecord adverse performance. \nEstablish a mechanism to collect and record user \nfeedback on the services provided by the contractor. \nLay down the policies and procedures for disciplinary action against breaches of contract \nconditions (e.g. deduction of payments or \ntermination of contract as provided for in the contract agreement) or unsatisfactory performance \n(e.g. issue of a warning letter or suspension from \ninvitation to bid for a specified period). \n12 \n  \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n  \n User / \nContract \nAdministration \nStaff Require the contractors to provide a staff list and the duty roster daily for monitoring purpose. \nHold regular meetings with the contractors to review their performance, highlighting any shortfalls in deliverables or complaints against the service provided. \nConduct surprise checks on the service provided, for example: \nFor cleaning contracts : \n Check the fulfilment of cleaning schedules \nbased on the work records and the standard of cleanliness (it is more effective to conduct the \ncheck closely after the completion of a job). \n Conduct head counts on an ad hoc basis if the \nnumber of cleaning workers is pledged in the \ncontract agreement. \nFor security contracts : \n Check attendance of security guards at the \nspecified guard posts. \n Check randomly the fulfilment of patrol frequencies as shown in the work records or through the computer if an electronic patrol \nrecord system is in use. \n Conduct head counts on an ad hoc basis to \nensure the required number of security guards \nis provided. \nRecord performance observed using a performance \nevaluation checklist (if used), or any adverse \nperformance observed (if not). \nEnsure that the contractor is aware of the \nobservations made during the surprise checks by \ngiving him a copy of th e performance evaluation \nchecklist or the record of adverse performance. \nIncrease the number of  surprise checks if \nirregularities are spotted repeatedly or complaints \nare received from the users. \n13 \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n  \n   \n \n  \n  \n  \n \n Require the contractors to keep a log book of all \nspecial or additional jobs ordered. \nCheck and certify completion of special and \nadditional job orders within a specified time limit (e.g. immediately after receipt of report of \ncompletion of a cleaning job by the contractor) for verification of payment claims. \n2.12 Taking of Disciplinary Action \n2.13 Processing of Payments User / Based on the adverse record s made during the site \nContract visits ( 2.11), take disciplinary action against the \nAdministration contractors. \nStaff \nKeep proper records of the disciplinary actions taken and make reports to the management periodically. \nUser / Contract \nAdministration \nSt\naff Require the contractor to submit an invoice, together with the supporting documents (e.g. workers’ \nattendance and work records) for claims of payment. \nMake a pledge or set an internal time limit for the certification of payment clai ms to avert allegations \nof deliberate holding up of payment to the \ncontractors. \nChecks claims of payment against the attendance and work records and any special orders of work. \nCheck if there is any record of under-performance or \ndisciplinary actions taken since last payment that \ninvolves payment deducti ons and ensure such \ndeductions are reflected in the payment. \n14 \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n  \n  \n \n Accounting Staff Certify accuracy by signing on the claim forms, \ninvoices and supporting documents to enhance \naccountability. \nCounter check the payment claims and supporting \ndocuments before effecting payment. \nEnsure payment claims ar e processed within the \ninternal time limit set or according to the time frame specified in the contract. \n2.14 Management Supervision \nManagement Arrange periodic audits on the processes for \nprocurement and monitoring  of service quality to \nensure compliance with the laid down policies and \nprocedures ( 2.1). \nRequire the audit staff to submit their findings direct to the senior management for information and \naction. \nInitiate investigation into cases of non-compliance \nor irregularities (e.g. inviting contractors not on the approved lists or shortlist to bid, or not selecting the \nbest price offer or the offer with the highest score, or \nordering frequent contract variations involving high costs), and call the responsible staff to account. \nProvide a channel for feedback or complaint from the contractors, and assign independent staff to look \ninto the case if any. \n15 \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n               \n \n  \n                          \n \n \n   \n     \n

The package consists of the following major elements. \n \nThe United Nations Guide for Anti-Corruption Policies  which contains a general \noutline of the nature and scope of the problem of corruption and a description of the major elements of anti-corruption policies, suitable for use by political officials and senior policy-makers. \n \nThe  general United Nations Anti-Corruption Toolkit , which contains a detailed set of \nspecific Tools intended for use by officials called upon to elaborate elements of a national anti-corruption strategy and to assemble these into an overall strategic framework, as well as by officials call ed upon to develop and implement each specific \nelement. More toolkits are currently bei ng tailor-made for judges, civil society and \nprosecutors in requesting countries to address their specific needs.  The Compendium of  International Legal Instruments on Corruption , in which all the \nmajor relevant global and regional international treaties, agreements, resolutions and other instruments are compiled for reference purposes. These include both legally \nbinding obligations and some so-called \"soft-law\" (or normative) instruments intended to \nserve as non-binding standards.

Over the years, however, several major developments in international anti-\ncorruption efforts have occurred as corruption issues surfaced repeatedly as a major concern of Member States, and on 30 September 2003  they successfully finalised the \nUN Convention Against Corruption after two years of deliberations.    \nThe Convention marks a major step forward in international cooperation against \ncorruption and is a demonstration of near universal concern at the challenges corruption poses to countries around the world and in every stage of development. A summary of the instrument is included in the introductory part of this Handbook.  References to \nrelevant specific provisions of the Convention appear throughout the Handbook , and a \nmore detailed review is included in Chapter 12 dealing with international judicial co-\noperation.   \n \nThe nature and effects of corruption are unique to each country and society. This Handbook  takes its place among the toolkit that continues to be developed by the United \nNations Office on Drugs and Crime.  This is intended to provide a range of options that \nenable each country to assemble an effective integrated strategy, adapted to meet its \nown particular needs.  \n  \n \n Antonio Maria Costa \n       EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR, \nUNITED NATIONS OFFICE ON DRUGS AND CRIME  \n \n 4ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS \n.  \n \nThe United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) acknowledges the contribution \nof Petter Langseth, the editor supervising the production of the Handbook  on Practical \nAnti-Corruption Measures for Prosecutors and Investigators, Natalie Christelis, Abdullahi Shehu, Oliver Stolpe and Andrew Wells. \nMajor contributors to the Handbook  are Barry Hancock of the International Association of \nProsecutors, Jeremy Pope and Diana Miller, both of TIRI1, and Fiona Darroch\n.2 \nThe first version of the Manual could not have been attempted without the invaluable support of the United States Department of Justice, and in particular that of Michael A. \nA. DeFeo. This second version (now entitled the “United Nations Handbook on Practical \nAnti-Corruption Measures for Prosecutors and Investigators”) would not have been possible without the support of the U.S. Department of Justice, and in particular John Harris, Senior Counsel for International Policy; Kenneth Harris, Associate Director, Office of International Affairs; and Sima Serrafin, Assistant United States Attorney for the District of Columbia.  \n \nDrafts of the Handbook  were thoroughly commented on by both a Government of South \nAfrica Task Team and by the Regional Office for Southern Africa of the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC/ROSA). These comments, together with the draft Handbook, were presented and further discussed during two Working Meetings \norganised by UNODC, held in Pretoria (16 to 18 October 2002) and Cape Town (21 to \n23 October 2002).   The International Association of Prosecutors (IAP) fed in the views of its members in some twelve countries from around the world. The development of this edition of the Handbook has been widely welcomed. The expectation is that elements of the \nHandbook  will form the basis for other publications, tailored to meet the needs of a \nparticular developing country or region.  The Handbook  itself will continue to be developed. Practical training and case studies \nwill be added, setting out practical examples to enhance the usefulness of the Handbook  \nas a training tool. This will provide information about the conditions under which a \nparticular programme may be able to work, and how various practical anti-corruption measures can be adapted to suit the circumstances of a particular developing country.  To achieve this, this, key staff from UNODC may need to first work with partners in key \ncountries and regions who have been tasked with adapting the Handbook  to local \ncircumstances and then to disseminate successful outcomes that may warrant replication in other, similar countries.  \n                                            \n1 the governance-access-learning network \n2 who prepared the case study on the Lesoth o Highlands Water Supply prosecutions \n \n \n 2 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS \n \n           \n Page \n Foreword Acknowledgements  \nIntroduction: The United Nations Convent ion Against Corruption      6 \n Chapter 1:  The Role of the Pros ecutor and the Investigator    11 \nChapter 2:  Corruption Defined         23 Chapter 3:  Preconditions for Succ essful Investigations     31 \nChapter 4:   Detecting Corruption        50 Chapter 5:  Gathering and Use of Evidence in Corruption Cases    57 \nChapter 6:  Informants, Witne sses and their Protection     65 \nChapter 7:  Whistleblower Protection        72 Chapter 8 : Financial Investigations        77 Chapter 9:  Electronic Surveillance        80 Chapter 10:  Undercover Operations        85 Chapter 11:  Integrity Testing         91 Chapter 12:  The Framework for Inter national Judicial Cooperation    97 \nChapter 13:  Extradition        110 Chapter 14:  Mutual Legal Assistance      121 Chapter 15:  International Repatri ation of Illicit Assets    132 \n Annex:  Lesotho Case  Study      137 \n Bibliography          212 \n \n \n 3 \n                                                          TABLE OF CONTENT \nFOREWORD \nAKNOWLEDGEMENT \nUNITED NATIONS CONVENTON AGAINS CORRUPTION \nA.

INTRODUCTION \n \nOne of the landmark developments in the fight against corruption around the world is the United Nations Convention against Corruption. Negotiations among Member States were concluded in Vienna on 30 September 2003, after two years of deliberation. At the official opening ceremony in Merida, Mexico, in December 2003, nearly 100 States \nsigned the new instrument, a number indicative of the height of concern about the \nproblem, and getting the new Convention off to a very promising start.   The Convention marks a major step forward in international cooperation against corruption, References to specific provisions of the Convention appear throughout this \nHandbook  and a more detailed review has been included in Chapter 12, on the topic of \ninternational judicial cooperation.   The Convention covers a wide range of measures, both domestic and international, and by no means all are mandatory. Some provisi ons require stated actions by State Parties \n(“Each State Party shall…”) and others specify the legitimacy of certain actions but do \nnot make them compulsory (“State Parties may…”).   \n At first sight the second category may seem a trifle odd. state does not require “permission” from others to take constitutionally-permissible steps to counter corruption. However, many of these are provisions that many negotiators wished to have as \nmandatory, but on which a sufficient consensus has not yet been reached.  The \nexpectation is that in future revisions of the Convention these provisions will be revisited to see whether a consensus has emerged in favour of at least some being made mandatory then.    \n Article 1* \nStatement of purpose \nThe purposes of this Convention are: \na) To promote and strengthen measures to prevent and combat corruption more efficiently and effectively; \nb) To promote, facilitate and support international cooperation and technica l assistance in the prevention of \nand fight against corruption, including in asset recovery; \nc) To promote integrity, accoun tability and proper management of pub lic affairs and public property. \n \n*UN CONVENTION AGAINST CORRUPTION  \n \n 7B. SUBSTANTIVE HIGHLIGHTS  OF THE UN CONVENTION  \n \n1. Prevention.   \n \nIt is a fact of life that corruption can only be prosecuted after the fact, and that \nprosecutions are time-consuming, costly, uncertain, and can only be brought when \nevidence of corrupt conduct is available.  First and foremost, any anti-corruption strategy should have a strong emphasis on prevention.   An entire chapter of the Convention is therefore dedicated to prevention, with measures \ndirected at both the public and private sectors. These include model preventive policies, \nsuch as the establishment of anticorruption bodies and enhanced transparency in the financing of election campaigns and political parties. States must endeavour to ensure that their public services are subject to safeguards that promote efficiency, transparency and recruitment based on merit. Once recruited, public servants should be subject to codes of conduct, requirements as to financial and other disclosures, and appropriate \ndisciplinary measures.  \n Transparency and accountability in matters of public finance should also be promoted.  Specific requirements are identified for th e prevention of corruption in particularly \nvulnerable areas of the public sector, such as the judiciary and public procurement. \nThose who use public services are entitled to expect a high standard of conduct from \ntheir public servants.   Preventing public corruption also requires an effort from members of society at large. For these reasons, the Convention calls on countri es actively to promote the involvement \nnon-governmental and community-based organi zations,sss and to raise both public \nawareness of corruption and what can be done to combat it. \n  \n2. Criminalization.  \n The Convention requires countries to establish criminal and other offences to cover a \nwide range of acts of corruption, if these are not already crimes under domestic law. In some instances, states are obliged to establish offences; in others they are required to  \nArticle 6* \nPreventive anti-corruption body or bodies 1. Each State Party shall, in accordance with the f undamental principles of its legal system, ensure the \nexistence of a body or bodies, as appropriate that prevent corruption by such means as: \n(a) Implementing the policies referred to in article 5 of  this Convention and, wher e appropriate, overseeing \nand coordinating the implement ation of those policies; \n(b) Increasing and disseminating knowledge about the preventio n of corruption. \n2. Each State Party shall grant the body or bodies refe rred to in paragraph 1 of this article the necessary \nindependence, in accordance with the fundamental prin ciples of its legal system, to enable the body or \nbodies to carry out its or their functions effectively a nd free from any undue influence. The necessary material \nresources and specialized staff, as well as  the training that such staff may r equire to carry out their functions, \nshould be provided. \n3. Each State Party shall inform the Secretary-Genera l of the United Nations of the name and address of the \nauthority or authorities that may a ssist other States Parties in devel oping and implementing specific \nmeasures for the prev ention of corruption. \n \n*UN CONVENTION AGAINST CORRUPTION\n \n \n \n 8“consider” doing so. The Convention goes beyond previous instruments of this kind, \ncriminalizing not only basic forms of corruption such as bribery and the embezzlement of public funds, but also “trading in influence” and the concealment and “laundering” of the \nproceeds of corruption. Offences committed in support of corruption, including money-\nlaundering and obstructing justice, are also covered. Other offences address problematic areas in the private sector.    \n3. International cooperation .  \n \nStates Parties agree to cooperate with one another in every aspect of the fight against \ncorruption, including prevention, investigation, and the prosecution of offenders. They are bound by the Convention to render specific forms of mutual legal assistance in the gathering and transfer of evidence for use in court, and to extradite fugitive suspects. \nThey are also required to undertake measures that will support the tracing, freezing, \nseizure and confiscation of the proceeds of corruption.   4. Asset recovery.  \n \nIn a major breakthrough, countries agreed on providing international assistance for asset recovery. This  is described as being “a fundamental principle of the Convention.”   \nThe issue is one of particular importance for many developing countries where high-level \ncorruption has plundered the national wealth, and where resources are sorely needed for the reconstruction and rehabilitation of failed institutions under new governments. Reaching agreement on this chapter involved intense negotiations, as the needs of countries seeking the return of illicit assets had to be reconciled with the legal and \nprocedural safeguards of the countries whose assistance would be sought.  \n Several provisions specify how cooperation and assistance will be rendered.  In the case of embezzlement of public funds, the confisca ted property would be returned to the state \nrequesting it. The proceeds of other offences covered by the Convention would also be \nreturned to that country, where there was proof of ownership by, or recognition of harm \ndone to, the requesting state.  Where this is not the position, priority consideration would Chapter IV \nInternational cooperation \n \nARTICLE 43* \nInternational cooperation \n1. States Parties shall cooperate in criminal matte rs in accordance with articles 44 to 50 of this \nConvention. Where appropriate and consistent with t heir domestic legal system, States Parties shall \nconsider assisting each other in investigations of  and proceedings in civil and administrative matters \nrelating to corruption. \n2. In matters of international cooperation, whenever dual criminality is considered a requirement, it shall \nbe deemed fulfilled irrespective of whether the la ws of the requested State Party place the offence \nwithin the same category of offence or denominat e the offence by the same terminology as the \nrequesting State Party, if the conduc t underlying the offence for which assistance is sought is a criminal \noffence under the laws of  both States Parties. \n \n*UN CONVENTION AGAINST CORRUPTION  \n \n 9be given to the return of confiscated property to the requesting state to enable it to return \nthe assets to prior legitimate owners, or  use it to compensate other victims of the offence.  \n \nEffective asset-recovery provisions will support the efforts of countries to redress some \nof the worst effects of “grand corruption” while sending at the same time, a message to \nother officials who may be tempted to move illicit assets off-shore that there is no place where they are safe.                                                                                                                                                                        \n5. Implementation mechanisms.   \n The states that have signed the Convention are now developing the required legislative \nand administrative measures, and ratifying t he new instrument. When the Convention \nhas 30 ratifications, it will come into force as between those state signatories. To promote and review implementation, a Conference of the States Parties has been established by the Convention. This will m eet regularly and serve as a forum both for \nreviewing implementation by States Parties and for facilitating the activities envisaged by \nthe Convention.  \n6. The Convention and the Handbook.  \n \nBy Article 60 , each State Party, to the extent necessary, is required to implement training \nprogrammes for personnel responsible for preventing and combating corruption, \nincluding the use of evidence gathering and investigative measures. This Handbook  has \nbeen designed as a contribution by the UNODC to these ends. Chapter V \nAsset recovery \n \nArticle 51* \nGeneral provision The return of assets pursuant to this chapter is a fundamental principle of th is Convention, and States \nParties shall afford one another the widest measur e of cooperation and assi stance in this regard. \n \n*UN CONVENTION AGAINST CORRUPTION\n \n \n 10C. QUESTIONES FOR DISCUSSION \n \n0.1 What are the differences between the Convention’s definition of “Corruption” and \nthe definition of “Corruption” in your country?  What are the similarities? \n \n0.2 Do you think it is possible to modify national legislation to be consistent with the \nConvention? \n 0.3 What areas do you think the national legislation falls short of the international \nprinciples stipulated in the convention? \n- Criminalization? \n- Preventive Measures? - International Cooperation? - Asset Recovery? - Technical Assistance and Information Exchange? \n \n0.4 What are the main problems of corruption in your country and to what extent did \nyou feel the Convention addresses these issues? \n 0.5 Do you feel that the tools given by UNODC are valuable and practical in relation \nto improving the judiciary’s practices in trying corruption cases? \nIs it valuable for your personal career? \n 0.6 Does your country need any additional as sistance in anti-corruption preventive \nmeasures, training within the judiciary, law enforcement, etc? \n \n0.7 What is the level of integrity among prosecutors in your country? \n 0.8 What is the level of corruption among investigators? \nAmong prosecutors? \n \n0.9 In what ways may a prosecutor abuse their position? \n 0.10 What areas do find the largest abuses of their position among prosecutors?  0.11 Is there any ethical standards or codes of conduct among prosecutors that are \nmandatory?  \n \n0.12 Is there any independent body that regulates these prosecutors?  \n  \n \n 11CHAPTER 1 \n \nTHE ROLE OF THE PROSECUTOR AND THE \nINVESTIGATOR \n \n \nA.  THE ROLE OF THE PROSECUTOR \n \nThere is considerable diversity in prosecution-investigator arrangements both between \ncountries of the common law and the civil law traditions and within each grouping.  Systems of prosecution reflect existing indigenous law to the extent that it has been \nrecognized by the legal system, and in many countries systems includes laws that date \nback, some cases for generations, to periods of colonization or other foreign occupation. To varying degrees, too, many have embraced more recent reforms to the common law or to European law and have incorporated these into local law, to which, of course, has to be added the separate legal development of each jurisdiction.   \nGiven the multiplicity of arrangements to whic h these processes have given rise, it is not \npossible to identify a consistent model at common law for defining the prosecutor-investigator relationship, and within the civil law system there are variations as well. However, there are universally-recognised basic values, and concerns for human rights, that should underpin the prosecution-investigator functions, however these are \napportioned, which are addressed later in this Chapter. \n \nIn the civil law tradition, the prosecution of suspected offenders is undertaken by a \nspecial prosecuting authority, either a public prosecutor or an investigating judge. Where an investigation is in the hands of a judicial  officer, continuing judicial oversight is \nguaranteed. In common law countries, where this does not occur, investigators and \nprosecutors must, on occasions, apply to a court for permission to conduct certain categories of coercive activity. Later Chapters of this Handbook  should be read with this \nparticular distinction in mind.  Many common law countries have a strict divide, at least on paper, between the \ninvestigator and the prosecutor.  The prosecutor is kept apart from the investigation in \norder to be able to assess the adequacy of evidence, etc. dispassionately and objectively. This is a differentiation that is diffi cult to sustain in practice, and the dividing \nline is gradually becoming blurred, especially in specialist cases such as major corruption investigations. Investigators will frequently need the assistance of prosecutors \nwhen it comes to assistance with investigatory processes, rather than with an \ninvestigation itself. However, increasingly prosecutors are being drawn into much closer relationships with investigators, and it is against this background that this manual has been prepared. It is written, too, in recognition of the fact that there are many commonalities between the various procedural  systems, and the fundamental values \nand ethics that underpin the investigation and prosecution processes are, in truth, \nuniversal. \n \n \n 12Dr Tony Krone has observed that:  \n \nThe prosecutor is acquiring an increasingly impor tant role in investigations spurred on by \ntwo main factors, which of themselves re flect underlying tensions between the often \ncompeting imperatives of fairness and effici ency in common law criminal procedure. The \nfirst factor is the desire for efficiency and the need to coordinate investigation and \nprosecution efforts for the pursuit of crimes that are complex, or that are particularly \ndifficult to regulate or investigate.  This has already been recognised for some time in \nrelation to environmental prosecutions which have also been managed without \nnecessarily relying on criminal sanctions.  The second is the increasing demand placed on \nthe prosecutor to objectively provide fu ll disclosure of the prosecution case and \nobjectively assess the prosecution case. Incr easing attention must therefore be paid by \nprosecutors to examine exculpatory evidence in the hands of the prosecutor and to consider the nature of the investigation.\n In both these respects, existing procedures have \nbeen shown to be inadequate and the prosecutor is being made responsible for \nmaintaining the integrity of the justice sy stem. The questions that then remain are \nwhether the trust placed in the prosecutor  is deserved, whether prosecution decision \nmaking is open and transparent and to the extent that it already is, whether it will remain \nso, and whether there are sufficient  accountability mechanisms in  place. Certainly, there \nis a need for guidelines for the investigativ e prosecutor as that office takes on an \nincreasingly important role.3 \n \nThese comments have much in common with the concerns expressed by critics of the \ncivil law processes. \n \nB. THE LAWYER AS PROSECUTOR AND AS DEFENDER \n The role of the prosecutor is significantly different from that of a lawyer for the defence. The defence lawyer has some duties wider than that of simply defending a client, such \nas not knowingly misleading the court.  In contrast,  the prosecutor represents society, and therefore has a duty to ensure that a defendant receives the fair trial that is \nguaranteed by the country’s constitution and that is recognised internationally as a \nfundamental human right by the Universa l Declaration of Human Rights and the \nInternational Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. It is therefore for the prosecutor to defend the public interest – which is to ensure that the Rule of Law is respected, that an accused person receives a fair trial, and that only the guilty are convicted. The prosecutor can only achieve these goals by being objective, honest, impartial and \nindependent. \n It is because of the special nature of a prosecutor’s role that he or she is obliged to make disclosure to the defence of evidence which might be helpful to the defence but which the prosecutor is not intending to use. M any prosecutors would wish that a similar \nobligation were imposed on the defence ! \n The duties and responsibilities of the public prosecutor have been described in the following terms: \n… the prosecutor is at all times a minister of justice, though seldom so described. It is not \nthe duty of prosecuting counsel to secure a conviction, nor should any prosecutor ever \nfeel pride or satisfaction in the mere fact of success. Still less should he boast of the \n                                            \n3  The issues are discussed at length in Dr Tony Krone, The Limits of Prosecution Authority  \n(Australian Institute of Criminolog y paper presented at the Regulatory Institutions Network, Australian \nNational University, 18 November 2003).  \n \n 13percentage of convictions secured over a peri od. The duty of the prosecutor, as I see it, \nis to present to the tribunal a precisely formulated case for the [State] against the \naccused, and to call evidence in support of it. If a defence is raised that is incompatible \nwith his case he will cross-examine, di spassionately and with perfect fairness, the \nevidence so called, and then address the tribunal  in reply, if he has the right, to suggest \nthat his case is proved. It is not rebuff to his prestige if he fails to convince the tribunal of \nthe prisoner’s guilt. His attitude should be so objective that he is, so far as is humanly \npossible, indifferent to the result. … It may be argued that it is for the tribunal alone, \nwhether magistrate or jury, to decide guilt or innocence.4 \n \nIn the United Nations Guidelines on the Role of Prosecutors5, these duties are described \nas follows:  \n12. Prosecutors shall, in accordance with the law, perform their duties fairly, consistently \nand expeditiously, and respect and protect human dignity and uphold human rights, thus \ncontributing to ensuring due pr ocess and the smooth functioning  of the criminal justice \nsystem.  \n13. In the performance of thei r duties, prosecutors shall: \n(a) Carry out their functions impartially and av oid all political, social, religious, racial, \ncultural, sexual or any ot her kind of discrimination; \n(b) Protect the public interest, act with objecti vity, take proper account of the position of \nthe suspect and the victim, and pay attention to all relevant circumstances, irrespective of \nwhether they are to the advantage or disadvantage of the suspect; \n(c) Keep matters in their possession confidentia l, unless the performance of duty or the \nneeds of justice require otherwise; (d) Consider the views and concerns of vict ims when their personal interests are affected \nand ensure that victims are informed of their rights in accordance with the Declaration of \nBasic Principles of Justice for Victims of Crime and Abuse of Power.  \n14. Prosecutors shall not initiate or continue prosecution, or shall make every effort to \nstay proceedings, when an impartial invest igation shows the charge to be unfounded. \n \n15. Prosecutors shall give due attention to th e prosecution of crimes committed by public \nofficials, particularly corruption, abuse of power, grave violations of human rights and \nother crimes recognized by international law and, where authorized by law or consistent \nwith local practice, the investigation of such offences. When prosecutors come into possession of ev idence against suspects that they know or \nbelieve on reasonable grounds was obtained through recourse to unlawful methods, \nwhich constitute a grave violation of the suspect's human rights, especially involving \ntorture or cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, or other abuses of \nhuman rights, they shall refuse to use su ch evidence against anyone other than those \nwho used such methods, or inform the Court accordingly, and shall take all necessary \nsteps to ensure that those re sponsible for using such methods are brought to justice. \n \n                                            \n4  In a speech, by Christmas Humphreys, Senior Pros ecuting Counsel at the Old Bailey, at the Inns of \nCourt in 1955: [1955] CrimLR 739,740-41. \n5  Guidelines on the Role of Prosecutors; ad opted by the Eighth United Nations Congress on the \nPrevention of Crime and the Treat ment of Offenders, Havana, Cuba , 27 August to 7 September 1990 \nhttp://www.unhchr.ch/html/menu3/b/h_comp45.htm   \n \n 14The standards for prosecutors have been articu lated by the International Association of \nProsecutors, and these bear setting out in full6 : \n1. Professional Conduct  \nProsecutors shall : \n• at all times maintain the honour and dignity of their profession; \n• always conduct themselves professiona lly, in accordance with the law and the \nrules and ethics of their profession; \n• at all times exercise the highest standards of integrity and care; \n• keep themselves well-informed and abreast of relevant legal developments; \n• strive to be, and to be seen to be, consistent, independent and impartial;  • always protect an accused person's right to  a fair trial, and in particular ensure \nthat evidence favourable to the accused is disclosed in accordance with the law \nor the requirements of a fair trial; \n• always serve and protect the public interest;  \n• respect, protect and uphold the universal concept of human dignity and human \nrights.  \n 2. Independence \n2.1 The use of prosecutorial discretion, when permitted in a particular jurisdiction, should \nbe exercised independently and be free from political interference. \n2.2 If non-prosecutorial authorities have the right to  give general or specific instructions to \nprosecutors, such instructions should be: \n•         transparent; \n•        consistent with lawful authority; •       subject to established guidelines to safeguard the actuality and the perception of \nprosecutorial independence. \n2.3 Any right of non-prosecutorial authorities to direct the institution of proceedings or to \nstop legally instituted proceedings shoul d be exercised in similar fashion. \n 3. Impartiality  \nProsecutors shall perform their duties without fear, favour or prejudice. \nIn particular they shall: \n• carry out their functions impartially; • remain unaffected by individual or sectional interests and public or media \npressures and shall have regard only to the public interest;  \n• act with objectivity; • have regard to all relevant circumstances,  irrespective of whether they are to the \nadvantage or disadvantage of the suspect; \n• in accordance with local law or the require ments of a fair trial, seek to ensure that \nall necessary and reasonable enquiries are made and the result disclosed, \nwhether that points towards the guilt  or the innocence of the suspect; \n• always search for the truth and assist the court to arrive at the truth and to do  \ndictates of fairness. \n \n4. Role in criminal proceedings  \n4.1 Prosecutors shall perform their duties  fairly, consistently and expeditiously. \n4.2 Prosecutors shall perform an active role  in criminal proceedings as follows:  \na) where authorised by law or practice to par ticipate in the investigation of crime, or \nto exercise authority over the police or  other investigators, they will do so \nobjectively, impartially and professionally; \nb) when supervising the investigation of  crime, they should ensure that the \ninvestigating services respect legal pr ecepts and fundamental human rights;  \n                                            \n6  Standards of professional responsibility and statement of the essent ial duties and rights of \nprosecutors adopted by the International As sociation of Prosecutors on 23 April 1999; \nhttp:// www.iap.nl.com/stand2.htm    \n \n 15c)  when giving advice, they will take care to remain impartial and objective; \nd)  in the institution of criminal proce edings, they will proceed only when a case is \nwell-founded upon evidence reasonably believed to be reliable and admissible, \nand will not continue with a prosecution in the absence of such evidence; \ne) throughout the course of the proceeding s, the case will be firmly but fairly \nprosecuted; and not beyond what is indicated by the evidence; \nf)  when, under local law and practice, they exercise a supervisory function in \nrelation to the implementation of court decisions or perform other non-\nprosecutorial functions,  they will always act in the public interest. \n 4.3 Prosecutors shall, furthermore;  \n• preserve professional confidentiality;  \n• in accordance with local law and the requirements of a fair trial, consider the \nviews, legitimate interests and possible co ncerns of victims and witnesses, when \ntheir personal interests are, or might be, affected, and seek to ensure that victims \nand witnesses are informed of their rights; \n• and similarly seek to ensure that any aggrieved party is informed of the right of \nrecourse to some higher authority/court, where that is possible; \n• safeguard the rights of the accused in  co-operation with the court and other \nrelevant agencies; \n• disclose to the accused relevant prejudic ial and beneficial information as soon as \nreasonably possible, in accordance with the law or the requirements of a fair trial; \n• examine proposed evidence to ascertain if  it has been lawfully or constitutionally \nobtained; \n• refuse to use evidence reasonably believed to have been obtained through \nrecourse to unlawful methods which constitute a grave violation of the suspect's \nhuman rights and particularly methods which constitute torture or cruel treatment; \n• seek to ensure that appropriate action is taken against those responsible for \nusing such methods; \n• in accordance with local law and the requirements of a fair trial, give due \nconsideration to waiving prosecution, discontinuing proceedings conditionally or \nunconditionally or diverting criminal case s, and particularly those involving young \ndefendants, from the formal justice syst em, with full respect for the rights of \nsuspects and victims, where such action is appropriate. \n \n5. Co-operation  \nIn order to ensure the fairness and effectiv eness of prosecutions, prosecutors shall:  \n• co-operate with the police, the courts , the legal profession,  defence counsel, \npublic defenders and other government agencies, whether nationally or \ninternationally; and \n• render assistance to the prosecut ion services and colleagues of other \njurisdictions, in accordance with the la w and in a spirit of mutual co-operation. \n \n6. Empowerment \nIn order to ensure that prosecutors are able to carry out their prof essional re sponsibilities \nindependently and in accordance with these standards, prosecutors should be protected \nagainst arbitrary action by governments.  In general they should be entitled: \n• to perform their professional functions without intimidation, hindrance, \nharassment, improper interference or unjustified exposure to civil, penal or other \nliability; \n• together with their families, to be phy sically protected by  the authorities when \ntheir personal safety is threatened as a result of the proper discharge of their \nprosecutorial functions; \n• to reasonable conditions of servic e and adequate remuneration, commensurate \nwith the crucial role performed by them and not to have their salaries or other benefits arbitrarily diminished; to reas onable and regulated tenure, pension and \n \n 16age of retirement subject to conditions of  employment or election in particular \ncases; \n• to recruitment and promotion based on objective factors, and in particular \nprofessional qualifications, ability, inte grity, performance and experience, and \ndecided upon in accordance with fair and impartial procedures; \n• to expeditious and fair hearings, based on law or legal regulations, where \ndisciplinary steps are necessitated by complaints alleging action outside the range of proper professional standards; \n• to objective evaluation and decis ions in discip linary hearings; \n• to form and join professional associations or other organisations to represent \ntheir interests, to promote their profe ssional training and to protect their status; \nand to relief from compliance with an unlawfu l order or an order which is contrary \nto professional standards or ethics. \n \n \nC.  THE DECISION TO PROSECUTE \n \nIn common law jurisdictions, prosecutors are fa ced daily with decisions as to whether or \nnot to prosecute. In some countries in the civil law tradition, however, (e.g. Czech Republic, Croatia) the decision to prosecute presents no problems: the prosecutor, \nunder the principle of strict legality, is required to prosecute every case where there is \nsufficient evidence to sustain a prosecution. In others (e.g. Belgium) the prosecutor has the discretion to drop a case completely if there is no public interest in a particular prosecution continuing. In yet another group of civil law countries, prosecuting authorities not only have a discretion whether or not to prosecute, but also have the \nability to drop some categories of cases on conditions and without convictions, provided \nthe suspected offender agrees (e.g. to being bound over, or to paying a fine, as in Germany and in The Netherlands).  The exercise of discretion whether or not to prosecute is an exceedingly onerous task, \nsuch are the consequences for the suspect, for the victim and for the community alike.  \nA decision to prosecute should only be taken after the evidence and the surrounding factors, including those favourable to the suspect, have been carefully considered. An misguided decision to prosecute can erode public confidence in the criminal process, as well as inflicting undeserved stress on a person wrongfully charged.   \nA Canadian justice minister once observed that the carrying out of the duties of a \nprosecutor is difficult: \nIt requires solid professional judgment and legal competence, a large dose of practical \nlife experience and the capacity to work in an atmosphere of great stress…[T]here is no \nrecipe that guarantees the right answer in  every case, and in many cases reasonable \npersons may differ.  A prosecutor who expect s certainty and absolute truth is in the \nwrong business. The exercise of prosecutor ial discretion is not an exact science. The \nmore numerous and complex the issues, the greater the margin for error.7 \n \nHowever, it has seldom been the position in the common law world that those suspected of criminal offences must automatically face prosecution.  A charge is viewed as only \nbeing appropriate if it is in the public interest (a situation that also prevails in some \ncountries of the civil law tradition).  In determining where the public interest lies, a prosecutor must examine all the factors and the circumstances. These will vary from \n                                            \n7  Morris Rosenberg, Deputy Minister of Justic e, Canada quoted in The St atement of Prosecution \nPolicy and Practice (Hong Kong). \n \n 17case to case, and no two cases will be exactly the same.  In countries where \nprosecutors have discretion, they do not act as  a “rubber stamp”, as it is not considered \nappropriate to pursue every single case without regard to the justice of the situation.  In \ngeneral, however, the more serious the offence, the more likely it is that the public \ninterest will require a prosecution if t here are reasonable prospects of obtaining a \nconviction.   In defence of the “legality principle”, and of always prosecuting when the there is sufficient evidence to sustain a conviction, it can be said that this helps to eliminate \npotential areas for corruption within the legal process by removing the discretion.  If a \nsuspect is to escape conviction, it must be after the evidence has been heard publicly, in open court.  It will not be the result of a decision taken behind closed doors, in a prosecutor’s office. At the level of constitutional principle it is defended as preventing a vacuum in accountability.  \n \nAs one prosecutor has written:  \nThe constitutional legislator had to solve a very serious problem. If public prosecutors \nwere to be independent, they could not be subject to monitoring by other powers… but \n[without] monitoring there would be a lack of accountability in the system… so the \nlegislators thought it would solve the problem  by preventing prosecutors from having any \ndiscretion in starting up a criminal action [by providing] for mandatory criminal action. The \noutcome is that the legality principle makes t he fundamental principles of our Constitution \nmore effective.8   \n \nThe writer acknowledges that the mandatory system would work more effectively when \nthe law provided fewer crimes than it does at present, and argues that “administrative sanctions can be more effective against less serious illegal behaviour”.\n \n In order to ensure consistency in decision making and to promote public understanding \nof the role of the prosecutor, some countries publish formal statements of their \nprosecution policies. \n \nD.  UNIFORM GUIDELINES FOR INVESTIGATIONS \n \nThe Conference of International Investigators periodically brings together the major investigative bodies attached to international and bilateral organisations that are involved in providing aid and support. \n \nTheir working conferences are designed to improve co-operation among the agencies, to establish good practices in investigations and to give investigators an opportunity to meet and discuss matters of mutual intere st. Some 80 representatives from about 30 \norganisations, including the World Bank and the United Nations, participated in a recent \nconference, in Brussels in April 2003, where the theme was co-operation in the fight \nagainst fraud and corruption.  During the conference the delegates developed 'Uniform Guidelines for Investigations'\n9 \nwhich the conference expects to be adopted by the organisations that attended. Adopting these Guidelines helps the agencies involved in this type of inquiry the better to \n                                            \n8  Gherardo Colombo, Discretionary power of public prosecution:  opportunity or legality principle – \nadvantages and disadvantages  (Council of Europe, Celle, 24 May 2004). \n9  europa.eu.int/comm/anti_fraud / press_room/pr/2003/09_en.html \n \n 18carry out their investigations in an open, transparent and accountable manner, and \nthereby ensure both the protection of fundamental rights and the interests of their organisations. The Standards also act as an international benchmark for the \ninvestigative agencies adopting them.  \n The Standards provide as follows: \n \nPrinciples \nA. Investigation is a profession requi ring the highest personal integrity. \nB. Persons responsible for the conduct of an investigation should demonstrate \ncompetence. \nC. Investigators should maintain objectivi ty, impartiality and fairness throughout the \ninvestigative process and timely disclose any  conflicts of interest to supervisors \nD. Investigators should endeavour to maintain both the confidentiality and, to the extent \npossible, the protection of witnesses . \nE. The conduct of the investigation should dem onstrate the Investigator’s commitment to \nascertaining the facts of the case. \nF. Investigative findings should be based on su bstantiated facts and related analysis, not \nsuppositions or assumptions. \nG. Recommendations should be support ed by the investigative findings. \n \nProcedural Guidelines \nPreparation 1. Complaints brought to the attention of t he Investigating Officer (IO) should be subject \nto careful analysis and handling. \n2. Complaints, which may include criminal co nduct or acts contrary to the rules and \nregulations of the Organization, should be registered, reviewed and evaluated to \ndetermine if they fall within the jurisdiction or authority of the IO. \n3. Information received by the IO should  be protected from unauthorized disclosure. \n4. The identities of those who make compla ints to the IO should be protected from \nunauthorized disclosure. \n5. Every investigation should be documented by the IO. \n6. Decisions on which investigations shou ld be pursued, and on which investigative \nactivities are to be utilized in a particular case, rest with the IO, and should include in \nany decision whether there is a legitimate basis to warrant the investigation and commit the necessary resources. \n7. The preparation for the conduct of an inve stigation should include necessary research \nof the relevant national laws, and rules and regulations of the organization; the evaluation of the risks involved in the case ; the application of analytical rigor to the \nevidence to be obtained and the assessment of the value, relevance and weight of the \nevidence; the measurement of the evidence against the relevant laws, rules and regulations; and the consideration of the m eans and time by which the findings should \nbe reported and to whom. \n8. The planning and conduct of the investi gation should reasonably ensure that the \nresources devoted to an investigation are proportionate to the allegation and the \npotential benefits of the outcome. \n9. The planning should include the development of success criteria for the identification of \nappropriate and attainable goals for the investigation. \n Investigative Activity \n1.  Investigative activity should include the collection and analysis of documents and \nother material; the review of assets and prem ises of the Organization; interviews of \nwitnesses; observations of the Investigators;  and the opportunity for the subject(s) to \nrespond to the complaints. \n2.  Investigative activity and critical decisi ons should be documented regularly with the IO \n \n 19managers. \n3.  Investigative activity should require the examination of all evidence, both inculpatory \nand exculpatory. \n4.  Evidence should be subject to validation including corroborative testimonial, forensic \nand documentary evidence. \n5.  To the extent possible, interviews should be conducted by two Investigators. \n6. Documentary evidence should be identified and filed with the designation of origin of \nthe document, location and date with the name of the filingInvestigator. \n7. Evidence likely to be used for judicial or  administrative hearings should be secured and \ncustody maintained. \n8.  Investigative activities by an IO s hould not be inconsistent with the rules and \nregulations of the Organization, and with due consideration to the applicable laws of \nthe State where such activities occur. \n9. The IO may utilize informants and other sources of information and may assume \nresponsibility for reasonable expenses incu rred by such informants or sources. \n10. Interviews should be conducted in the language of the person being interviewed using \nindependent interpreters, unless otherwise agreed . \n11. The IO may seek advice on the legal, cult ural, and ethical norms in connection with \nan investigation. \n \nConfidentiality and the protection of witnesses \n1. Where it is has been established that a witn ess, or other person assisting in the IO’s \ninvestigation, has suffered retaliation because of assistance in an investigation, the IO \nshould undertake, or otherwise engage management to undertake, actions so as to prevent such acts from taking effect or  otherwise causing harm to the person. \n2. Where an individual makes a complaint on a matter subject to the authority of the IO, \nthat individual’s identity should be protect ed from unauthorized disclosure by the IO. \n3. Where there has been an unauthorized disclosu re of the identity of a witness, or other \nperson assisting in the IO’s investigation,  by a staff member of the IO, available \ndisciplinary measures should be pursued. \n \nDue Process \n1. Subjects of investigation should be advised by the IO of the complaints against them, \nwith the time and manner of disclosure to be made keeping in mind fairness to the \nsubject, the need to protect the integrity of the investigation and the interests and rules \nof the Organization. \n2. Investigative methods may include t he gathering of documentary, video, audio, \nphotographic or computer forensic evidence  at the election of the IO, provided such \nactivities are not inconsistent with t he applicable rules and regulations of the \nOrganization, and with due consideration to the applicable laws of the State where the \nactivity occurs. \n3. Information received from witnesses and subjects should be documented in writing. \n \nFindings \n1. Where the investigative findings substant iate the complaint, those findings should be \nreported to the appropriate managers along with recommendations for corrective \naction, where appropriate, which may includ e redress in courts, in disciplinary or \ndebarment proceedings and in other sanctions available to the manager, and for the \nsteps needed to minimize the risk of recurrence. \n2. Where investigative findings are either insufficient to substantiate or discredit the \ncomplaint, those findings should be repor ted and the affected subject cleared. \n3. Where investigative findings adduced during an investigation tend to show that the \nlaws of a State have been violated, considerat ion should be given to referring the case \nto the appropriate national law enforcement agency. \n4. Where there are investigative findings tendi ng to prove that the complaint was made in \nbad faith or with malicious or negligent disregard of the facts, the IO may recommend \n \n 20that appropriate action be taken against the complainant. However the mere fact that \nthe complaint is found by the IO to be unsubstantiated is insufficient for such \nresponse. \n5. The standard of proof should conf orm to the standards required by the \nOrganization and/or by the national jurisd iction for referrals to them, but should \ngenerally be reasonably sufficient evidence. \n6. The IO should strive to ensure that its recommendations are implemented in a timely \nfashion and reviewed. \n \nIt is against the background of these principles and the ethics they embody that this \nHandbook  has been prepared. \n \n \nE.  THE ROLE OF THE INVEST IGATOR/PROSECUTOR OUTSIDE THE \nFIELD OF ENFORCEMENT \n \nThis Handbook  has been prepared on the basis that most investigators and prosecutors \nwill not see their role as being confined merely to performing their functions within existing rules and frameworks.  They will, of co urse, respect the rules in their day-to-day \nactivities, but should be alive to the continuing and broader need for reforms, and \ncontribute insights from their daily work. In par ticular, they will have a strong interest in \ncorruption prevention. There can be no doubt that investigators and prosecutors are uniquely placed by their work experience to play a continuing role in shaping their country’s anti-corruption agenda. \n \nFor this reason, the Handbook  goes beyond the everyday business of investigation and \nprosecution. It includes material designed to stimulate investigators and prosecutors to develop the reform element of their role in an informed and effective fashion.  \n \n 21D. CHAPTER 1; QUESTIONS FOR DISCUSSION \n \n1.1 Do you believe investigators and prosecutors should be independent?  If so, how \nfar does this independence extend? Should they be accountable to anyone? If \nso, to whom and how? How do you balance the independence and the \naccountability of a prosecutor? Do you, yourself, consider that you are sufficiently independent so as to enable you to discharge your duties in a proper and professional fashion and without politically-motivated interference? \n \n1.2. What are the factors you would take into account in determining whether or not to \nprosecute a suspected offender?  How much evidence does there need to be to \njustify placing a person on trial? \n 1.3. You discover a case of political corruption that, if prosecuted, would cause great \nembarrassment to the government in the days leading up to a major international \nanti-corruption conference the government is hosting.  Would it be in the public \ninterest for you to prosecute? What do you understand the “public interest” to be? \n 1.4 You are given evidence that suggests that a senior figure in the government has \ntaken a kickback on a government contract and that the proceeds have gone into \nthe ruling party’s bank account to help pay for forthcoming elections.  What will \nyou do? And how will you go about it? Woul d you start your action before the \nelection is held or wait until after the election? Would it make any difference if the ruling party was re-elected? \n 1.5 Your have secured the conviction of a defendant who had pleaded “not guilty”.  \nSome time later, in the course of another investigation, you come across \nevidence unknown at the time of the trial, that suggests the original defendant was probably innocent.  What do you do? Would you act differently if the defendant was a known criminal with a long record for corrupt acts? \n \n1.6 Is a record kept of the complaints made against particular public officials to help \ninvestigators decide where patterns of corruption may be appearing?   \n1,7 At what stage of the investigation, should the prosecutor step in?  Should   he/she be present at all stages?  \n1.8 How many cases are prosecuted per year regarding corrupt government  \n officials?  Do you think that this correlates with the amount of corruption within  \nthe government?  If not, what do you think it should be done to improve the correlation?   \n1.09 What is the level of integrity among prosecutors in your country? What are their \n strengths? Have they weaknesses?  1.10 Do you believe there is any corruption among investigators? \nAmong prosecutors? If so, what are your grounds for believing this? What \npractical steps can be taken to remedy the situation? Why do you believe they \nhave not been taken? \n 1.11 In what ways may prosecutors be tempted to abuse their positions? \n \n 22 \nD. CHAPTER 1;  QUESTIONS FO R DISCUSSION (CONTINUED) \n \n \n1.12 In what, if any, areas would you expect to find the worst abuses of their position \namong prosecutors? \n 1.13 Are there  ethical standards or codes of conduct among prosecutors that are \nmandatory and can be enforced?  If so, are they enforced?   \n \n1.14 Is there an independent body that regulates the prosecutors? If not, do you \nbelieve one to be needed? If so, what sort of body should it be? \n  \n \n 23CHAPTER 2 \n \nCORRUPTION DEFINED \n \n \n There is no comprehensive, and universally accepted definition of corruption. The origin \nof the word is from the Latin corruptus (spoiled) and corrumpere (to ruin; to break into \npieces).  The working definitions presently in vogue are variations of \"the misuse of a public or private position for direct or indirect personal gain\".\n10  \n Attempts to develop a more precise definition invariably encounter legal, criminological \nand, in many countries, political problems. When the negotiations of the United Nations \nConvention against Corruption began in 2002, one option under consideration was to avoid the problem of defining corruption by simply listing a whole series of specific types or acts of corruption. After much discussion “corruption” was not defined at all, but repeated examples of what is covered by the expression appear throughout the text.\n11 \n \nMany specific forms of corruption are clear ly understood as such, and are the subject of \nnumerous legal and academic definitions. Many are criminal offences, although in some cases governments consider that a specific form of corruption (such as nepotism) may best be dealt with by way of regulatory or civil law controls. Some of the more commonly encountered forms of corruption are considered below.  \nA.  “GRAND” AND “PETTY” CORRUPTION  \n \n“Grand corruption” is an expression used to describe corruption that pervades the \nhighest levels of government, engendering major abuses of power. A broad erosion of the rule of law, economic stability and confidence in good governance quickly follow. Sometimes it is referred to as “state capture”, which is where external interests illegally \ndistort the highest levels of a political system to private ends.   \n “Petty corruption”, sometimes described as “administrative corruption”, involves the exchange of very small amounts of money, an d the granting of small favours. These, \nhowever, can carry considerable public losses,  as with the customs officer who waves \nthrough a consignment of high-duty goods having been bribed a mere $50 or so.  \n \nThe essential difference between grand corruption (“state capture”) and petty corruption (day-to-day administrative corruption) is that the former involves the distortion of central \nfunctions of government  by senior public officials; the latter develops within the context \nof functioning governance and social frameworks.  \n \nCorruption is said to be “systemic” where it has become ingrained in an administrative system. It is no longer characterised by ac tions of isolated rogue elements within a \npublic service. Where minor acts of petty corruption occur it is often thought best to \n                                            \n10  http://www.ustreasury.hu/nc500/lessons/glossary.htm \n11  Issues relating to attempts to define corru ption for purposes such as policy development and \nlegislative drafting are discussed in more detail in the Un ited Nations Manual on Anti-Corruption Policy, Part \nII. \n \n 24leave these to be dealt with by way of administr ative sanction (demotion, dismissal etc.), \nrather than invoke the whole weight of the criminal process.  \nWhen patterns of “petty corruption” are uncovered, investigators should consider \nwhether it is possible for them to track the way in which the proceeds are dispersed. Frequently, the front-line officials are not the principal villains but are being manipulated by their superiors.  \nB.  “ACTIVE” AND “P ASSIVE” CORRUPTION \n \nIn discussions of corruption offences the expressions “active bribery” and “passive \nbribery” often occur. \"Active bribery\" usually refers to the act of offering or paying a bribe, while \"passive bribery” refers to the requesting or receiving of a bribe. A corrupt transaction may be initiated under either rubric: by a person who offers a bribe or by an official who requests one. These definitions, used in a number of legal systems, are \nemployed in this Handbook.   \n \nThere is a difference betw een a corrupt action and an a ttempted, or incomplete, \noffence. For example, \"act ive bribery” would cover ca ses where the payment of a \nbribe has taken place, but might not co ver cases where a bribe was offered but \nnot accepted. In the formulation of comprehensive national anti-corruption \nstrategies care should be taken to ensur e that both situations are covered. \n \nC.  BRIBERY \n \nArticle 15* \nBribery of national public officials* \nEach State Party shall adopt such legislativ e and other measures as may be necessary to \nestablish as criminal offences, when committed intentionally: \n(a) The promise, offering or giving, to a public  official, directly or indirectly, of an undue \nadvantage, for the official himself or herself or anot her person or entity, in order that the official \nact or refrain from acting in the exercise of his or her official duties; \n(b) The solicitation or acceptance by a public offici al, directly or indirect ly, of an undue advantage, \nfor the official himself or herself or another person or entity, in order that the official act or refrain \nfrom acting in the exercise of his or her official duties.  \n \n*UN CONVENTION AGAINST CORRUPTION  \n \nBribery is the act of conferring a benefit in order improperly to influence an action or \ndecision. It can be initiated by an official who asks for a bribe, or by a person who offers \nto pay one. Bribery is probably the most common form of corruption. Definitions or descriptions appear in several international instruments, in the domestic laws of most countries as well as in academic publications.  Typically, it is used to describe a payment ex tracted by a public official from an unwilling \nmember of the public before the citizen can receive the service to which he or she is \nentitled. Strictly speaking, such a transacti on is not one of a “bribe” being given by an \naccomplice in corruption, but a “payment  being extorted” from an unwilling victim. \nHowever, in this Handbook  the more common usage is adopted. \n \n \n 25The \"benefit\" conferred by a “bribe” can take a variety of forms: cash, company shares, \ninside information, sexual or other favours, entertainment, employment or, indeed, the mere promise of a benefit in the future (such as a retirement job).  \n \nThe benefit can pass directly to the person bribed, or indirectly, to a third party such as a friend, relative, associate, favourite charity, private business, political party or election campaign.   The conduct for which the bribe is paid can involve a positive act on the part of the \nofficial (the making of a particular decision), or it can be passive (with the official \ndeclining to do something that he or she is obliged to do). It can be a bribe paid “according to the rule” (to obtain something the official is withholding but is under a public duty to provide); or it can be “against the rule” (a payment to encourage an official to ignore the rules in favour of the person offering the bribe).  Bribes can be paid \nindividually, on a case-by-case basis, or as part of a continuing relationship in which \nofficials receive regular benefits in exchange for regular favours.  Once bribery has occurred, it can lead to other forms of corruption. By accepting a bribe, an official becomes susceptible to being blackmailed and coerced into further, and more \nserious, derelictions of public duties. \n Most international and national legal definitions seek to criminalise bribery in all its forms. However, some seek to limit criminalis ation to situations where the recipient is a \npublic official or where the public interest is affected, leaving other cases of bribery to be resolved by non-criminal or non-judicial m eans. Some countries exclude bribery in the \nprivate sector, however, Article 21 of the UN Convention does provide that States Party \n“shall consider” criminalizing forms of bribery in the private sector.  In some jurisdictions where only the bribin g of public officials is criminalised, the \ndefinition of “public official” is defined so broadly as to extend to a private individual e.g. \nto a person who is not actually a public offici al but who is temporarily discharging public \nfunctions.  Examples of such functions would be the discharge of electoral functions, or where there is a jury, the performance of jury duties.   Any public official who has the power to make decisions or take actions affecting others is at risk, although some functions are more vulnerable than others (tax collection, \ncustoms, and offices that issue permits). Politicians, regulators, law enforcement \nofficials, judges, prosecutors and inspectors are also potential targets.  \nSpecific examples of bribery include: \n \n• a) Corruption against the rule.\n A payment or benefit is provided to ensure that the \ngiver or someone connected to him or her receives a benefit to which they are not \nentitled. \n• b) Corruption with the rule.  A payment is made to ensure that the giver or someone \nconnected to him or her actually receives a service to which they are lawfully entitled. \n• c) Offering or receiving improper gifts,  gratuities, favours or commissions. In some \ncountries, public officials commonly accept tips or gratuities in exchange for their \nservices, frequently in violation of relevant  codes of conduct. As links always develop \nbetween payments and results, such payment s become difficult to distinguish from \nbribery or extortion. \n \n 26• d) Bribery to avoid liability for taxes . Officials in revenue collecting agencies, such as \ntax and customs, may be asked to reduce the amounts demanded or to overlook \nevidence of wrongdoing, including evasion or similar crimes. They may also be \ninvited to ignore illegal imports or exports, or to turn a blind eye to illicit transactions, such as money-laundering. \n• e) Bribery in support of fraud\n. Payroll officials may be bribed to participate in abuses \nsuch as listing and paying non-exist ent employees (\"ghost workers\"). \n• f) Bribery to avoid criminal liability . Law enforcement officers, prosecutors, judges or \nother officials may be bribed to ensure that criminal activities are not properly \ninvestigated or prosecuted or, if they are prosecuted, to ensure a favourable \noutcome. \n• g) Bribery in support of unfair competition for benefits or resources . Public or private \nsector employees responsible for making contracts for goods or services (public \nprocurement) may be bribed to ensure that contracts are made with the party that is paying the bribe, and on unjustifiably favourable terms. Where the bribe is paid out of the contract proceeds themselves, it is described as a \"kickback\" or secret \ncommission. \n• h) Private sector bribery\n. Corrupt banking and finance officials are bribed to approve \nloans that do not meet basic security criteria and are certain to default, causing \nwidespread economic damage to individuals, institutions and economies. Just as bribes can be offered to public officials conducting public procurements, so, too, can bribes pollute procurement transactions  wholly within the private sector. \n• i) Bribery to obtain confidential or \"inside\" information\n. Employees in the public and \nprivate sectors are often bribed to disclose confidential information and protected \npersonal details for a host of commercial reasons.  \n• j) Influence peddling : Public officials or political or government insiders sell illicitly the \naccess they have to decision-makers. Influence peddling is distinct from legitimate political advocacy or lobbying (see Article 18 of the UN Convention). In some \ncountries, legislators demand bribes in exchange for their votes in favour of particular pieces of legislation. \n \nD.  EMBEZZLEMENT, THEFT AND FRAUD  \n \nIn the context of corruption, embezzlement, theft and fraud all involve stealing by an \nindividual exploiting his or her position of employment. In the case of embezzlement, \nproperty is taken by someone to whom it has been entrusted (e.g. a payclerk). \n Fraud involves the use of false or misleading information to induce the owner of property to part with it voluntarily. For example, an official who helps himself to part of a shipment of food aid, but is not responsible for its administration, would be committing theft; an \nofficial who induces an aid agency to overs upply aid by misrepresenting the number of \npeople in need of it, would be committing fraud.  \"Theft\", per se, goes well beyond the scope of any definition of corruption. Using the same example of the relief shipment, an or dinary bystander who steals aid packages \nfrom a truck would be committing theft, but not of a kind that would fall within commonly-\naccepted definitions of corruption. However,  “embezzlement” - essentially the theft of property by someone to whom it was entrusted  - is universally regarded as falling within \ncorruption definitions wherever it occurs, carrying with it, as it does, a breach of a fiduciary duty.  \n \n 27 \nExamples of theft, fraud and embezzlement abound. Virtually anyone responsible for storing or handling cash, valuables or other tangible property is in a position to steal it or \nto assist others in stealing it, particularly if auditing or monitoring safeguards are \ninadequate or non-existent. Employees or o fficials with access to company or \ngovernment operating accounts can make unauthorized withdrawals, or pass to others the information required for them to do so.   Elements of fraud can be more complex. Officials may create artificial expenses; \"ghost \nworkers\" may be added to payrolls, “ghost roads” may be constructed at great cost, and \nfalse bills submitted for non-existent goods, services, or travel expenses. The purchase \nor improvement of privately-owned houses and farms may be billed against public funds – for example, government-paid workers may be used illegally to repair and paint officials’ private homes. Employment-relat ed equipment, such as motor vehicles, may be \nused for private purposes without requisite permissions. The costs to the public purse \nmay not seem great, but in one case, the illicit use of a World Bank-funded fleet of vehicles to take the children of officials to school was accounting for fully 25 per cent of the fleet’s total running costs. \n \nE.  EXTORTION \n \nWhereas bribery involves the use of payment s and positive incentives, extortion relies \non coercion to induce cooperation, such as threats of violence or the exposure of sensitive information. As with other forms of corruption, the loser can be the general public interest, individuals adversely affected by a corrupt act or decision, or both. In \nextortion cases, however, there is a very r eal \"victim\": the person who is coerced into \nsubmitting to the will of the official. \n Extortion may be committed by government offi cials but they can also be the victims of \nit. For example, a person seeking a favour can extort payment from an official by making threats. Investigators are all too often the subject of threats to themselves and their \nfamilies’ safety. \n In some cases, extortion may differ from bribery only in the degree of coercion involved. A doctor may solicit a illicit payment for seeing a patient more quickly than would otherwise be the case. But if the need to see the doctor is a matter of medical urgency, and the payment must be made to gain access to the doctor, the demand can be  more \nproperly characterised as \"extortion\".  \n Officials in a position to initiate or conduct criminal prosecution or punishment can use the threat of prosecution or punishment as a means for extortion. In many countries, people involved in minor incidents, such as traffic accidents, may be threatened with \nmore serious charges unless they “pay up”. Alternatively, officials who have committed \nacts of corruption or other wrongdoings may be threatened with exposure unless they themselves pay up. Low-level extortion, such as the payment of \"speed money\" to \nensure timely consideration and decision-maki ng of minor matters by officials, is \nwidespread in many countries.  \n \nIn many situations it is not always clear  what the position is: when a citizen makes a \npayment without being asked, the individual may simply be making it because of an understanding that if the payment is not made,  the services to which the citizen is \n \n 28entitled will be withheld. Here the system itse lf is systemically corrupt.  The position is \nfurther complicated where a society has long-standing traditions of gift-giving unconnected to expectations of special or improper treatment. \n \nF.  ABUSE OF FUNCTION \n \nArticle 19* \nAbuse of functions  \nEach State Party shall consider adopting such legislative and other measures as may be \nnecessary to establish as a criminal offence, when committed intentionally, the abuse of functions \nor position, that is, the performance of or failure to perform an act, in violation of laws, by a public \nofficial in the discharge of his or her function s, for the purpose of obtaining an undue advantage \nfor himself or herself or for another person or entity. \n \n*UN CONVENTION AGAINST CORRUPTION  \n \nIn many cases, corruption involves the abuse of function or  discretion. A customs official may have to assess the value of a consignment of goods or decide which of several \nsimilar categories should be used to assess duty. An official responsible for government \ncontracting may exercise discretion to purchase goods or services from a company in which he or she holds a personal interest. Another may propose real estate developments that will increase the value of his or her own property.   \nSuch abuses are often associated with bureaucracies in which there are broad individual \ndiscretions and inadequate oversight and accountability structures. They also flourish where decision-making rules are so complex that they neutralize the effectiveness of any accountability mechanisms that do exist. Many  anti-corruption strategies involve a \nreassessment of all areas of discretion, and attempt to limit these to a minimum. \n \nG. FAVORITISM AND NEPOTISM \n \nBy definition, favouritism, nepotism and clientelism all involve abuses of discretion, \nalthough a number of countries do not criminalise the conduct (Article 7 of the UN Convention covers merit selection without even mentioning nepotism). Such abuses usually involve not a direct personal benefit to an official but promote the interests of those linked to the official, be it through family, political party, tribe, or religious group.  \n \nA corrupt official who hires a relative (nepotism) acts in exchange, not of a bribe but of the less tangible benefit of advancing the interests of others connected to the official. The unlawful favouring of - or discrimination against - individuals can be based on a wide range of group characteristics: race, religion, geographical factors, political or other \naffiliation, as well as personal or organizational relationships, such as friendship or \nshared membership of clubs or associations.   This being said, there are occasions where public policy dictates that “affirmative action” programmes be implemented, or that steps be ta ken to ensure that the public service is \nfully representative of the people it serves. In these examples, discrimination is likely to \nbe lawful, or even required by law. \n \n 29 \nH.  CREATING OR EXPLOITING CONFLICTING INTERESTS  \n \nAs noted in the United Nations Manual on Anti-corruption Policy, most forms of \ncorruption involve the creation or exploitation of some conflict between the professional \nresponsibilities of an individual and his or her private interests. The offering of a bribe \ncreates such a conflict where none may have existed hitherto.   By contrast, most cases of embezzlement, theft or fraud involve an individual yielding to temptation and taking undue advantage of a conflict that already exists. In both the \npublic and private sector, employees and officials are routinely confronted with \ncircumstances in which their personal interests conflict with those of their responsibility to act in the best interests of the state or their employer. Well-run organisations have systems to manage these situations, us ually based on clear codes of conduct. \n \nI.  IMPROPER POLITI CAL CONTRIBUTIONS  \n \nIt is extremely difficult to make a distinction between legitimate contributions to political \norganizations, and payments made to influence events illicitly once the recipients are in power. A donation made because a donor supports a political party and wishes to increase its chances of being elected is usually not a corrupt act; it is an important part of the political system of many countries, and in some it is considered to be a basic right \nof self-expression protected by the constitution. A very large donation made with the \nintention or expectation that the party will, once in office, unduly favour the interests of the donor is tantamount to the payment of a bribe.  In most democracies regulating political party financing has proved difficult, even in those countries that opt for the public funding. A common approach to combating the \nproblem is to require the disclosure of contributions, so ensuring that both the donor and \nrecipient are politically accountable. Another measure is to limit the size of individual \ncontributions to prevent the danger some donors having too much influence.    \n \n 30J. CHAPTER 2:  QUESTIONS FOR DISCUSSION \n \n2.1 Does your country have a definition for “Corruption?”   \n2.2 If not, would it be helpful for there to be a legal definition of “corruption”?  If so, \nwhat would this be?  \n 2.3 How would you\n personally like corruption to be defined? \n \n2.4. How would you assess the occurrence of corruption within your country’s public \nadministration?  \n 2.5 Where do you see challenges in trying corruption cases?  Restrictive laws of \nevidence, obtaining evidence, obtaining the cooperation of witnesses? \n 2.7 Are all forms of bribery criminalized in your country? \n \n2.8 Are there any exceptions to bribery, such as allowing for “gifts” in the \nadministrative process? \n 2.9 Are there laws against bribery or corruption in the private sector within your \ncountry? If not, would it be helpful if there were? Has the law any place in \ninterfering with matters like this when they are not in the public sector?   \n 2.10 How would the public interest be served if these laws did exist?  2.11 Where criminal law is lacking in regulating bribery or corruption in the private \nsector, are there opportunities for recovery by harmed individuals through the \ncivil law?   \n 2.12 When prosecutions are successful, can the courts make compensation orders in \nfavour of the victims or do they have to bring separate court proceedings?   \n \n2.13 As a prosecutor, do you see it as a part of your duties to assist victims to recover \ntheir losses? \n 2.14 For the prosecutor, are there any essential differences in investigations of “grand \ncorruption” from investigations of “petty corruption”? \n \n2.15 Does the use of two different  terms serve any useful purpose? \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n 31CHAPTER 3 \n \n PRECONDITIONS FOR SUCCESSFUL INVESTIGATIONS \n \n \n \nA. INTRODUCTION \n \nThere are no universal rules for investigating corruption, but some of the following \nelements, if incorporated into national strategies, will assist in the development of  structures that facilitate the carrying out of investigations effectively. Information derived from investigations should be capable both of supporting criminal prosecutions and of assisting in the reorganisation of public or private administration to make these more \nresistant to corruption.\n \n \nThe autonomy and security of investigations are both important, not only to encourage and protect those who report corruption or assist in other ways, but also to ensure that the results of investigations, whether they uncover corruption or not, are valid and \ncredible. \n \nB.  INDEPENDENCE AND ACCOUNT ABILITY OF INVESTIGATORS AND \nPROSECUTORS \n \nIt is axiomatic that victims, witnesses and informants must receive protection against those under investigation. Equally important is the “protection” of officials responsible for \ninvestigating corruption through guarantees of independence. Functional independence \nensures that investigations are effective, by reducing opportunities for corrupt officials to \ninterfere. Independence also instils confidence both in the investigators and in the bureaucracies or agencies they investigate.  Where the investigation is independent, the \npublic at large is assured that complaints will be investigated professionally and fairly, and that the investigators and prosecutors can be trusted to act properly and in the \npublic interest. \n Article 36 of the UN Convention Against Corruption is mandatory on State Parties. It requires each of them “in accordance with the fundamental principles of its legal system, [to] ensure the existence of a body or bodies or persons specialized in combating \ncorruption through law enforcement. Such body or bodies or persons shall be granted \nthe necessary independence, in accordance with the fundamental principles of the legal system of the State Party, to be able to carry out their functions effectively and without any undue influence.” \n \nThe mechanics of functional independence vary from one system to another. Most incorporate elements of judicial independence to ensure the integrity of court \nproceedings, but the means for securing autonomy for the prosecutorial and \ninvestigative functions differ. In systems wher e criminal investigations are carried out by \nmagistrates or other judicial officials, such functions fall within the ambit of judicial \nindependence.   \n \n 32Where investigations and prosecutions are carried out by non-judicial personnel (e.g. in \ncommon law jurisdictions), judicial oversight may still play a role in guaranteeing their independence and their accountability. As such oversight applies only to cases that \ncome before the courts, other ways must be found to monitor key functions, such as the \nconduct of investigations and the manner in which decisions are taken to determine what is to be investigated and ultimately whether a prosecution is to be brought.   \nArticle 11* \nMeasures relating to the judiciary and prosecution services \n1. Bearing in mind the independence of the judici ary and its crucial role in combating corruption, \neach State Party shall, in accordance with the fundamental principles of its legal system and \nwithout prejudice to judicial independence, take measures to strengthen integrity and to prevent \nopportunities for corruption among members of the judiciary. Such measures may include rules \nwith respect to the conduct of members of the judiciary. \n2. Measures to the same effect as those taken pursuant to paragraph 1 of this article may be \nintroduced and applied within the prosecution service in those States Parties where it does not \nform part of the judiciary but enjoys independence  similar to that of the judicial service. \n \n*UN CONVENTION AGAINST CORRUPTION  \n \nThe problem of quis custodiet ipsos custodes?  (Who shall guard the guardians?)  also \narises when structures are being developed to separate corruption investigations from other elements of government activity. Just as the agencies involved must be independent enough to protect their functions against improper interference, they must \nalso be subject to sufficient oversight to prevent abuses and to identify any occurrences \nof corruption on the part of investigators and prosecutors themselves. Although the problem of internal corruption is common in law enforcement and prosecutorial agencies generally, it is arguably more critical in dedicated anti-corruption agencies. Where these exist there will almost certainly be attempts to bribe, coerce or otherwise influence \ninvestigators, often by sophisticated and powerful corrupt officials or organized criminal \ngroups. For their own protection, as well as to serve the public interest, it is essential for investigators to be accountable for their actions. Such oversight should not extend, however, to interference with operational decisions, such as whether a particular \nindividual should be investigated, what methods should be used, or whether a case warrants criminal prosecution. Decisions to discontinue investigations should, however, \nbe subject to independent scrutiny. \n \nC.  CODES OF CONDUCT \n \nThe codification of clear and unambiguous standards of conduct, in which all applicable standards are assembled into a comprehensive code for specified groups of employees, \nserve several purposes: \n \na) They establish the standards  which the leaders of the organization and all the \nmanagers are pledged to follow (and so set a clear example of “walking the talk”). b) They elaborate what is expected of a specific employee  or group of \nemployees, thus helping to instill fundamental values that curb corruption. In \nmany cases, codes are also “aspirati onal”: they include descriptions of conduct \nthat is expected as well as procedural rules and penalties for dealing with breaches of the code. \n \n 33c) They provide a basis for employee training  and the discussion of standards of \nconduct. d) They can form the basis for disciplinary action  in cases where an employee \nbreaches or fails to meet prescribed standards and set out procedures and \nsanctions for non-compliance.   e) They enable employees to know in advance (as is their right) what the \nstandards are, making it more difficult to fabricate disciplinary action as a way of \nimproperly intimidating or removing employees. f)  Let the public know through an awareness campaign what they can expect \nfrom the courts  and where to complain if they are not served according to these \nstandards \n Codes of conduct will often include anti-corruption elements, but also common are such basic performance standards as fairness, impartiality, independence, integrity, loyalty \ntowards the organization, diligence, propriety of personal conduct, transparency, \naccountability, responsible use of organizational resources and, where appropriate, standards of conduct towards the public.   Codes may be developed for the entire public service, specific sectors of the public \nservice or, in the private sector, specific  companies or professional bodies such as \ndoctors, lawyers or public accountants. Several models have been developed to assist those developing such codes.   However, it is important to bear in mind the fact that the way in which a code is created can be at least as valuable as the resulting code itself.  By engaging staff across an \norganization in discussions as to the organization’s values and the standards of conduct \nexpected of all staff, the content of the code is internalized and a sense of ownership developed.  Imposed codes of conduct hav e seldom had any significant effect. \n \nFollowing consideration of corruption issues by the Fifth Session of the United Nations Commission for Crime Prevention and Criminal  Justice, the General Assembly in 1996 \nadopted an International Code of Conduct for Public Officials\n12. The Code (which has no \nlegal force as such) emphasizes: \n (a) The need for loyalty of officials to the public interest.  (b) The pursuit of efficiency, effectiveness and integrity.  \n(c ) The avoidance of bias or preferential treatment, and ensuring responsible \nadministration of public funds and resources. \n(d) The avoidance of conflicts of interest by disqualification or non-\nparticipation where a private interest conflicts with a public responsibility while in office and with respect to previous offices, and \n(e)  The need for disclosures of assets, the refusal of gifts or favours and the \nprotection of confidential information obtained in the course of public \noffice.  \n The Code also discusses issues arising from conflicts between partisan political activity \nand the public interest, stressing the need to contain partisan political activity by public officials and outlining exceptions to the gener al principle. Officials should not engage in \nmajor political activity unless their office is itself a political one, that is, an  elected office. \nRoutine political activities should be limited to those that do not impair either the function \n                                            \n12  http://www.un.org/documen ts/ga/res/51/a51r059.htm   \n \n 34of the office or public confidence in it, thus a flexible balance is struck that would vary \naccording to the nature of both the political activities in question and the particular public office involved. \n \nOf particular importance is the Code of Conduct for Law Enforcement Officials developed by the UN High Commissioner fo r Human Rights and adopted by General \nAssembly resolution 34/169 of 17 December 1979\n13.   \n This stresses that: \n(a) In the performance of their duty, law enforcement officials shall respect and \nprotect human dignity and maintain and uphold the human rights of all persons (Article 2).  \n(b) The use of force by law enforcement officials should be exceptional; while it \nimplies that law enforcement officials may be authorized to use force as is \nreasonably necessary under the circumstances for the prevention of crime or \nin effecting or assisting in the lawful arrest of offenders or suspected offenders, no force going beyond that may be used (Article 3).  \n(c) Matters of a confidential nature in the possession of law enforcement officials \nshall be kept confidential, unless the performance of duty or the needs of \njustice strictly require otherwise.\n Great care should be exercised in \nsafeguarding and using such information, which should be disclosed only in the performance of duty or to serve the needs of justice. Any disclosure of such information for other purposes is wholly improper. (Article 4).  \n(d) No law enforcement official may inflict, instigate or tolerate any act of torture \nor other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, nor may any \nlaw enforcement official invoke superior orders or exceptional circumstances \nsuch as a state of war or a threat of war, a threat to national security, internal political instability or any other public emergency as a justification of torture or other cruel, inhuman or degrading tr eatment or punishment (Article 5, \nembodying standards from other UN instruments). \n(e) Law enforcement officials shall ensure the full protection of the health of \npersons in their custody and, in particular, shall take immediate action to secure medical attention whenever required (Article 6), and that, \n(f) Law enforcement officials shall not commit any act of corruption. They shall \nalso rigorously oppose and combat all such acts.  Any act of corruption, in the same way as any other abuse of authority, is incompatible with the \nprofession of law enforcement officials. The law must be enforced fully with \nrespect to any law enforcement official who commits an act of corruption, as Governments cannot expect to enforce the law among their citizens if they cannot, or will not, enforce the law against their own agents and within their agencies (Article 7). \n \nAs with the United Nations, the Council of Europe has developed a Model Code for the \nConduct of Public Officials\n14 for use by countries engaged in the drafting of their own \ncodes of conduct. Many of the standards are similar, but the Council of Europe’s Code covers a wider range of public service conduct.   \n                                            \n13  http://www.unhchr.ch/html/menu3/b/h_comp42.htm   \n14  http://cm.coe.int/ta/r ec/2000/2000r10.htm   \n \n 35The more important elements from an anti-corruption standpoint include: \n(a) Avoidance of conflicts of interest (articles 8 and 13-16), (b) A duty to act loyally (article 5), legally (article 4), and impartially (article 7); \n(c) Prohibitions concerning gifts, improper offers and other forms of undue \ninfluence (articles 18-20); and, \n(d) The accountability of public officials (articles 10, 25) \n Of particular interest are Articles 13-16, which deal with conflicts of interest in more detail than most other instruments. The provisions cover a range of possible conflicts of \ninterest, and place positive obligations on the official involved (who will often be the only \nperson aware of the existence of a conflict). The official is required to identify and disclose potential conflicts, to take appropriate steps to avoid them, and to comply with any legal or operational decisions taken by others to resolve any conflicts. It also \nrequires that any conflict of interest declared by a candidate to the public service or to a \nnew post in the public service should be resolved before appointment. \n The need to strike a balance between legitimate forms of political activity and partisanship are also discussed. The provisions  deal with public officials in general but \nnot with those who serve, by reason of thei r election, to partisan political positions. \n \nArticle 8* \nCodes of conduct for public officials \n1. In order to fight corruption, each State Part y shall promote, inter alia, integrity, honesty and \nresponsibility among it s public officials, in acco rdance with the f undamental principl es of its legal \nsystem. \n2. In particular, each State Party shall endeavour to apply, within its own institutional and legal \nsystems, codes or standards of conduct for the correct, honourable and proper performance of \npublic functions.  \n3. For the purposes of implementing the provisions  of this article, each State Party shall, where \nappropriate and in accordance with the fundamental pr inciples of its legal system, take note of the \nrelevant initiatives of regional, interregional  and multilateral organizations, such as the \nInternational Code of Conduct for Public Officials contained in the annex to General Assembly \nresolution 51/59  of 12 December 1996. \n4. Each State Party shall also consider, in ac cordance with the fundamental principles of its \ndomestic law, establishing measures and systems to  facilitate the reporting by public officials of \nacts of corruption to appropriate authorities, when such acts come to their notice in the \nperformance of their functions. \n5. Each State Party shall endeavour, where appropriate and in accordance with the fundamental \nprinciples of its domestic law, to establish me asures and systems requiring public officials to \nmake declarations to appropriate authorities regarding, inter alia, their outside activities, \nemployment, investments, assets and substantial gifts  or benefits from which a conflict of interest \nmay result with respect to their functions as public officials. \n6. Each State Party shall consider taking, in ac cordance with the fundamental principles of its \ndomestic law, disciplinary or other measures a gainst public officials who violate the codes or \nstandards established in accordance with this article. \n \n*UN CONVENTION AGAINST CORRUPTION  \n \n \nG.  ADEQUATE TRAINING AND RE SOURCES FOR INVESTIGATORS \n \nAdequate training and resources are necessary to ensure that reported cases are dealt \nwith effectively and to encourage those aware of corruption to come forward with \n \n 36information. As observed above, informants are more likely to assume the risk of \nreporting if they are confident that effective action against corruption will be the result. Such confidence requires assurances not only that investigations will themselves be \nindependent and free of corruption, but also that investigators are actually capable of \ndetecting it, gathering evidence against offenders, and taking whatever measures are needed to discipline the offender and to eliminate recurrences. The commitment of significant resources to these ends also sends a powerful signal that, at the highest levels of Government, there is a strong commitment to the prevention and elimination of corruption. This commitment can serve both to deter potential offenders and to \nencourage informants to come forward. \n The wide range of corruption types requires an equally wide range of specific skills and knowledge on the part of investigation teams. Most will find frequent need for legal and accounting skills to identify, preserve and pr esent evidence in criminal proceedings and \ndisciplinary proceedings. The number of investigators with the necessary skills and \ntraining to work effectively generally depends on the extent of the resources available. As well as personnel and funding, other resources, such as systems for the creation, retention and analysis of records, are also important. The strongest evidence of high-level corruption will often be a long-term pattern of complaints about lesser abuses.  H.  CASE SELECTION STRATEGIES   \nNot every suspected case can be fully investigated and prosecuted. Given the extent of \ncorruption, the range of cases likely to exist, the variety of possible outcomes, and the limits imposed by human and financial resour ce constraints, most national anti-\ncorruption programmes will find it necessary to make priority choices as to the cases to \npursue, and the outcomes to seek.   Prioritizing involves the exercise of considerable discretion. This must be managed carefully to ensure consistency, transparency and the credibility of both the decision-\nmaking process and its outcomes. A major element of the process is the setting and, \nwhere appropriate, the publication of criteria for case selection (sometimes referred to as a prosecution policy paper)\n15. This can help to ensure that like cases are dealt with alike, \nand reassure those who make complaints, as well as members of the general public, that a decision not to pursue a particular reported case is based on objective criteria and not on improper or corrupt motives. \n \nCriteria generally to be considered should include the following: \n \n1. Seriousness and prevalence of the type of corruption \n Assuming that the fundamental objective of a national anti-corruption strategy is to \nreduce overall corruption as quickly as possible, priority may be given to cases that involve the most common forms of corruption. Where large numbers of individuals are involved, the cases will often lead to proactive outcomes such as the setting of new ethical standards and training of officials, rather than criminal prosecutions and punishments. Where there are patterns of widespread and longstanding \n                                            \n15  The Code of Conduct for Prosecutors in the United Kingdom, issued under Section 10 of the \nProsecution of Offences Act, gives gu idance on the general principles to be applied when making decisions \nabout prosecutions. http://www.cps.gov.uk/pub lications/prosecution/   \n \n 37misdemeanours, forms of amnesty may be appropriate so that a new page is turned, \nwhere officials are made aware that their working environment has changed and that the rules will henceforth be enforced.16  2. Legal nature of the alleged type of corruption \n \nBroadly speaking, corruption offences can be characterized being either criminal or administrative misconduct. Conduct that is not a crime cannot be punished as such. The nature of the offence will also often determine which agency deals with it and how it is \nprioritized. \n \n3. Cases that are needed to set precedents \n \nPriority can be given to cases that raise social, political or legal issues which, once an \ninitial \"test\" case has been resolved, will be applicable to many future cases. Examples \ninclude dealing publicly with common conduct not hitherto perceived as being corrupt in order to change public perceptions, and cases that test the extent of criminal corruption offences, and so either set a useful legal precedent or establish the need for legislation to close a legal gap. In the case of legal precedents, time-consuming appeals may be \nrequired which is another reason for starting court proceedings as soon as possible after \na case that raises the relevant issues has been identified. \n \n4. Viability or probability of satisfactory outcome  \n \nCases may be downgraded or deferred if an initial review establishes that no satisfactory \noutcome can be achieved. Examples include cases in which the only desirable outcome \nis a criminal prosecution, but a suspect has died or disappeared, or essential evidence has been lost. A suspect may also already be in prison serving a lengthy term, or be extremely old or critically ill. In the last two instances it may not be in the public interest to prosecute as this could be seen to be excessively oppressive conduct. Part of the \nassessment of such cases should also include a review of possible outcomes to see if \nother appropriate remedies may be available. \n \n5. Availability of financial, human and technical resources  \n \nThe overall availability of resources is always a concern in determining how many cases \ncan be dealt with at the same time or within a given period. The tendency for the burden \nof particular cases to fluctuate as investigations proceed requires a periodic reassessment of caseloads. Generally such fact ors will not be related to the setting of \npriorities with respect to the type of case taken up or the priority of individual cases, but there are exceptions. A single major case, if pursued, may result in the effective deferral \nof large numbers of more minor cases, and the unavailability of specialist expertise may \nmake specific cases temporarily impossibl e to pursue. An assessment of costs and \nbenefits before decisions are made is thus impor tant. In the case of \"grand corruption\" \nand transnational cases there can be substantial costs in areas such as travel and foreign legal services, but the public inte rest may demand that examples are made of \n                                            \n16  For a discussion, see “Dealing with the past; amnesty, reconciliation and other alternatives: Case \nStudy No.27 UNODC Anti-Corruption T oolkit, Second Edition, February 2004; \nhttp://www.unodc.org:80/pd f/crime/corruption/toolki t/AC_Toolkit_Edition2.pdf \n \n 38corrupt senior officials for reasons of deterrence and credibility, to recover large \nproceeds hidden either at home or abroad and to restore faith in government. \n \n6. Criminal intelligence criteria  \nAs overall expertise and knowledge are gained and greater numbers of individual cases are dealt with, intelligence information can be gathered and assessed. Such an evaluation will usually include research and the detection of overall corruption patterns, with conclusions being drawn about which the most prevalent offences are, and which \nare causing the most social or economic harm. It will also include the gathering of \nconfidential information about corruption patterns and links between specific offenders or organized criminal groups. Such procedures will assist in identifying cases with high priority and those that merit the allocation of significant resources.  \n \nI.  CASE MANAGEMENT \n \nSome corruption cases are simple and straightforward, with witnesses and evidence \nreadily available. In some, a simple integrity test may have established the corrupt tendencies of an official, meaning that no further investigation is necessary. Where corruption is systemic, the challenge is one of volume. It is all too easy for an \nenforcement agency to devote itself almost entirely to addressing minor infractions, to \nthe neglect of more serious and much more damaging conduct on the part of more senior officials. This may call for processes th at are essentially administrative in nature, \nrather than invoking the full force and weight of the criminal law. It is rather a matter of engineering fundamental changes in expectations of long standing, rather than invoking a multitude of criminal procedures.  \n \nMore serious corruption investigations (particularly those involving high-level or “grand” corruption) can be time-consuming, complex and expensive. To ensure the efficient use of resources and successful outcomes, the elements and personnel involved must be managed effectively.  Teams working on specific  cases will often require expertise in the \nuse of investigative techniques ranging from financial audits to intrusive techniques.  \n If, from the outset, legal proceedings are not excluded as a possible outcome, there may also be a need for legal expertise in areas such as the law of evidence and the human rights constraints on search and seizure. In complex investigations, teams may be assigned to specific target individuals, or to focus exclusively on individual aspects of the \ncase. One group might be engaged in the tracing of proceeds, for example, while others \ninterview witnesses or maintain surveillance of suspects.   These functions should be conducted in accordance with an agreed strategy and coordinated under the supervision of an investigative manager or lead investigator who \nshould receive information about the progress of investigators on a regular and frequent \nbasis.   The sequencing of actions can be of the greatest importance. The interviewing of witnesses and the conducting of search and seizure operations run the risk of disclosing \nto outsiders the existence of an investigation and, to some degree, its purpose. Thus, \nthey should not be undertaken until after other measures have been taken that will only be effective if the target has not been alerted. On the other hand, such procedures may become urgent if it appears that evidence could be destroyed or illicit proceeds moved \n \n 39outside the jurisdiction. Coordinating these fluctuating factors to maxim effective requires \ncompetent and well-informed senior investigators.   \nInvestigative management must be flexible and take account of information as it \naccumulates. Investigators develop theories about what an individual item of information may mean and how the various pieces may fit together, but such theories may require \nrefinement as an investigation proceeds. Investigators must always be open to other possibilities when new evidence appears that is inconsistent with the particular theory that is being pursued. Investigations of particular incidents of corruption will often turn up \nevidence of other, hitherto unsuspected, corrupt ion or other forms of criminal activity. \n \nJ.  SELECTION OF THE INVESTIGATION TEAM \n \nThe selection of an effective team is crucial to the success of an investigation. Members \nshould possess the specific investigative skills likely to be needed, should have proven \nintegrity, and should be willing to undertake the work. The team must be made aware of the personal implications of the investigation, in particular when undercover work is to be conducted. Skills needed to conduct large-scale corruption investigations typically include financial investigation, undercover and surveillance, information technology, \ninterviewing and witness preparation, report writing and the ability to analyse \nintelligence. The backgrounds of investigators should be thoroughly checked from time to time, including social and family ties and lifestyles. \n \nK.  MANAGEMENT OF INFORMATION  \n1. Internal information  \nAs an investigation proceeds, information should be made available promptly to those who may require it.  It should be retained in a format that is cross-referenced and is quickly accessible so that it can be reviewed as needed and so that links to other \nrelevant information can be made. \n Each piece of information should be assessed for its relative reliability, sensitivity and confidentiality. The assessment should be linked to the information itself as the degree of sensitivity may not be apparent to those unfamiliar with the information. For example, disclosure of facts that may seem insignificant in the context of a continuing investigation \nmay inadvertently identify a source who had been promised anonymity, thus possibly \nendangering the source and certainly undermining the ability of investigators to obtain similar information in the future. \n \n2. Media relations \n \nAnother critical element is media relations. Ensuring that accurate, timely and appropriate information is passed to the media is important for ensuring the transparency and the credibility of investigations. More fundamentally, media scrutiny and publicity are essential for gaining cooperation from the public, as well as for raising public awareness of the corruption phenomenon and for generating political will.  \n \nEnsuring that the media have access to accurate and authoritative information may also help to reduce any tendency to report information that is incorrect or harmful to the investigation. On the other hand, it is essential that information is not made available that \n \n 40might jeopardize a fair trial being given to a suspect. If an investigator has behaved \nabusively in this or in other respects, a court may discharge an accused on the grounds of prejudice without even hearing the case.  \n \nArticle 13* \nParticipation of society \n1. Each State Party shall take appropriate meas ures, within its means and in accordance with \nfundamental principles of its domestic law, to pr omote the active participation of individuals and \ngroups outside the public sector, such as ci vil society, non-governmental organizations and \ncommunity-based organizations, in the prevention of and the fight against corruption and to raise \npublic awareness regarding the existence, caus es and gravity of and the threat posed by \ncorruption. This participation should be  strengthened by such measures as: \n(a) Enhancing the transparency of and promotin g the contribution of the public to decision-\nmaking processes; \n(b) Ensuring that the public has effective access to information; \n(c) Undertaking public information activities that contribute to non-tolerance of corruption, as well \nas public education programmes, including school and university curricula; \n(d) Respecting, promoting and protecting the fr eedom to seek, receive, publish and disseminate \ninformation concerning corruption. That freedom ma y be subject to certain restrictions, but these \nshall only be such as are provided for by law and are necessary:  \n(i) For respect of the rights or reputations of others; \n(ii) For the protection of national security or  ordre public or of public health or morals. \n2. Each State Party shall take appropriate measur es to ensure that the relevant anti-corruption \nbodies referred to in this Convention are known to  the public and shall provide access to such \nbodies, where appropriate, for the reporting, incl uding anonymously, of any incidents that may be \nconsidered to constitute an offence estab lished in accordance with this Convention. \n \n*UN CONVENTION AGAINST CORRUPTION  \n \nInformation intended for publication must be reviewed carefully, both to ensure accuracy and to eliminate disclosures that could be harmful to the investigation. Only authorised \nindividuals should be permitted to release information or participate in press briefings. \nThose in contact with the media should be competent both in media relations and in the subject matter under discussion. They should not comment on matters that are beyond their expertise, and they should ensure that the information that is given to the media is \nconsistent.  3. Checks and balances (“guarding the guards”) \n \nIn an ideal world, the media has integrity.  In reality, in many countries the media is effectively \"for sale\" to the highest bidder. Corrupt individuals can manipulate the media \nto enhance their image or suppress or confuse information about their activities. This \ncan be done to build public support in their favour, however misguided, that can, of itself, create problems for investigators. Media m anipulation can also obstruct more general \nprogrammes to raise public awareness and to build cooperation with the enforcement agencies.   \nThe aim of an awareness-raising programme should be to win the active cooperation of \nthe media to achieve the broad public dissemination of the standards of conduct expected of individual public officials and of the existence of complaints mechanisms \nwhere these standards are not met. Such public awareness should lead to greater accountability of officials in the delivery of government services. The importance of \npublic trust in their government and its anti-corruption institutions is often \n \n 41underestimated. Without a basic level of public trust,  public complaints mechanisms ( see \nbelow ) will not work and witnesses will not come forward to facilitate the investigation \nand the prosecution of anti-corruption cases in the courts.  \n \nIt is beyond the scope of this handbook to discuss how the media as an institution can be strengthened and checks and balances introduced, however in some countries, professional journalist associations and media councils have been established to \nmonitor the integrity of newspapers and journalists.  \n \n4. Public complaints mechanisms \n \nPublic complaints mechanisms enable those confronted by corrupt practices or \nmaladministration, to report such practices in the expectation that appropriate action will follow. Complaints mechanisms should be permanent institutions, and more may be \nneeded. Different institutions can ensure that both citizens and public servants are able \nto report corrupt behaviour such as disloyalty, breach of trust, conflicts of interest, waste, or bad judgment without the risk of suffering any personal or financial advantages. The protection of “whistleblowers” is discussed in a separate chapter. \n \n(1) External mechanisms Various types of external complaint mechanisms can be provided for members of the \npublic. A leading example, found in many countries around the world, is the Office of the Ombudsman.\n17 In some countries, too, public servants are considered free to raise their \nconcerns with members of the legislature or, in serious cases, directly with law enforcement agencies.  However, it is usually considered to be desirable for institutions \nto be able to sort out internally all but the most serious of their problems. \n \n(2) Internal reporting procedures \nGovernment departments with effective int egrity regimes generally have well-developed \nprocedures to deal with complaints about potential dishonesty and problems of \nsupervisory and personal relationships. Such procedures should establish clearly what it \nis that constitutes a reportable incident or allegation, and to whom and how a report should be made.   Each organization is generally in a position to develop rules appropriate to its own culture and to that of the organizations with which it interacts.  A supervisor would \nnormally be the first point of contact of any allegation, but an ethics officer for the entire \norganization may be designated as the primary referral point as allegations frequently concern the supervisor or others in positions of authority above the level of the complainant. Some government agencies go so far as to provide an external organisation to handle complaints in the first instance to overcome this problem. The \nchain of referral to the appropriate investigating authority should be clear, with time limits \nand explicit standards governing the categories of allegation that must be referred for review by a criminal justice authority.   \n(3) Comparison \n \n                                            \n17  For a discussion of the role of the Ombudsman, see \nhttp://www.transparency.org/sourcebook/10.html .  \n \n 42A computerized programme can generate reporting comparisons concerning the making \nof complaints as between service delivery in differing geographical areas at the sub-national level.  F.  MANAGING THE SECURITY OF INVESTIGATIONS AND INVESTIGATORS \n \nThe maintenance of security is also a critical function.  As noted previously, protecting \nthe confidentiality of informants and other sources is often the only way to ensure cooperation; the leaking of sensitive information may endanger informants and warn \ntargets, allowing them to modify their behaviour, conceal or destroy evidence, or make \nother attempts to corrupt or disrupt the investigative process. Maintaining effective security requires an assessment of the full range of possible attempts to penetrate or disrupt anti-corruption investigators, both in general and in the context of specific investigations. Attempts may also be directed at obtaining information or denying \ninformation to investigators by disrupting, doctoring or destroying it; there may be \nintimidation, or even murder of the investigators themselves.   The following areas should be assessed: \n \n1. Physical premises  \nThe premises where investigators base their work and store information should be chosen with a view to being able to control entry, exit and access so that unauthorized persons may be kept out. Premises should also be resistant to attempts by anyone trying to gain entry when they are unoccupied. Where premises are part of larger law-\nenforcement or other government institution, they should also be separated physically \nfrom the rest of the establishment where they are located.   Threats to destroy evidence by demolishing th e premises themselves employing such \nmethods as arson or explosives may also require consideration. Important, too, can be \nsecurity against various forms of electronic surveillance, such as concealed \nmicrophones and transmitters. Thus premises should be chosen that are resilient to surveillance techniques, and there should be regular \"sweeps\" to detect devices that may have been installed since the most recent inspection. Where particularly critical information is at risk, it may be necessary to store copies offshore. \n \n2. Personnel Security  \nThe physical security of personnel must be guaranteed to ensure that competent investigators can be employed. A particular risk is posed where corrupt individuals succeed in gaining employment with t he agency. Generally, employees should be \ncarefully screened, examining their past history, life-styles, family ties and their other \nrelationships to identify any factors that might suggest a vulnerability to corruption. Such screening should be a continuous processes, not a one-off exercise before personnel are engaged. The very fact that they are working in the anti-corruption area can render them logical targets for the corrupt.  \nPotential threats to physical safety should be assessed regularly and, when identified, \nvigorously pursued. Other protective measures include advice with respect to security precautions, maintaining anonymity and providing weapons for use in self-defence. \n \n 43 \n3. Information, documents and communications \n A constant concern is that critical information does not fall into the hands of investigative \ntargets and so frustrate attempts to obtain evidence against them. Addressing such concerns requires that steps that attract public attention are not taken prematurely; that documents are used, stored and transported in secure conditions; that access to copying equipment is limited and monitored; and that  channels of electronic communication \nincluding wireless telephones, fax machines, radios, electronic mail and other media are \nresistant to unauthorized interception or monitoring. Where the physical security of \nchannels cannot be ensured, the use of encryption or similar technologies should be undertaken to ensure that unauthorised persons who access the data cannot decipher it.  As noted, in extreme cases it may be necessary to store vital documents and recordings in bank vaults in foreign countries.  4. Relationships with other agencies \n \nArticle 36* \nSpecialized authorities  \nEach State Party shall, in accordance with the fundamental principles of its legal system, ensure \nthe existence of a body or bodies or persons sp ecialized in combating corruption through law \nenforcement. Such body or bodies or persons sh all be granted the necessary independence, in \naccordance with the fundamental principles of t he legal system of the State Party, to be able to \ncarry out their functions effectively and without any undue influence. Such persons or staff of \nsuch body or bodies should have the appropriate training and resources to carry out their tasks. \n \n*UN CONVENTION AGAINST CORRUPTION  \n \nAnti-corruption agencies must ultimately account for their activities. This requires a \ndegree of timely reporting of information to the political or judicial bodies responsible for \nthe agencies’ oversight. The precise timing of a particular disclosure may vary, and can be a difficult issue. As a general principle, investigations should be reviewed externally only after they have been concluded. If abuses occur before investigations are over, some harm will occur and, in some cases, this will be irreversible. In such a case, it is \nappropriate for an investigator to be permitted to consult a more senior official for advice \nand guidance. Many systems make pr ovision for such an eventuality. \n \n5. Threat assessment \n Threats to the security of investigators and investigations should be assessed both in \ngeneral terms and in the context of each specific case. Relevant factors will include the number of individuals suspected, the extent to which they are organised and the sophistication of the corruption under investigation. Also relevant are the determination of the individuals or group targeted, the magnitude and scope of the corruption and its proceeds, whether the targets are involved in crimes other than corruption, and whether \nthere is any specific history of violence or attempts to obstruct investigations or \nprosecutions. \n \n \n 44G.  INVESTIGATIVE TECHNIQUES \n \nFinancial investigations into the life-styles, bank accounts and personal dealings of \nsuspected corrupt individuals have been shown to be a successful method of proving \ncriminal acts. The following are some of the other approaches that have proved to be highly effective in the investigation of widespread large-scale corruption \n \n1. Focus investigations \n If the results of a corruption investigation suggest that corruption and bribery in a certain \npublic service is widespread, one can concent rate on the systematic checking of the \nassets of as many suspected bribe takers as is feasible (See Financial Investigations, Chapter 8).  \nSuch an exercise may, however, not yield enough information to warrant further \ninvestigation. Some official activities almost \"invite\" widespread corruption as they create opportunities for large numbers of low-paid o fficials to receive small-scale bribes.  \n The issuing of licences and permits are good examples. Many people from whom bribes \ncan be extracted visit the agencies on a daily basis. Quite often, the frustrations of \napplying for a driving licence, obtaining permission to construct a new home, requesting copies of documents or seeking just about any other service to the public, involves an endless tangle of government \"red t ape\" and delay. Such an environment breeds \nfrustration and the making of small payments to resolve it. Indeed, some posit that some systems are deliberately designed to create opportunities for those who work in it to levy \ntheir “customers”. Others go so far as to suggest that historically this has been a way for \na state to avoid having to pay its employees adequately. In such cases, an investigation into the working files and practices of an agency will be much more effective and efficient than trying to investigate the financial records of its employees.   \nBefore devoting efforts to any investigation, it is important to evaluate the most cost-\neffective means of deploying staff. It may most effective simply to have senior managers replaced and new working practices introduced that eliminate – or at least reduce – \nopportunities for bribe-taking, coupled with an unambiguous warning to officials that the rules have changed and will henceforth be enforced. \n \n2. Terms of reference  \nBefore starting a major investigation, clear and comprehensive terms of reference (TOR) should be drafted. These should contain a comprehensive list of all the resources anticipated as being needed, be they human, financial or material. Particular \nconsideration should be given to any need for additional resources to maintain the \nsecrecy of the investigation. The suspect public servant may have connections to other public servants who could alert him or her to the investigation; he or she may even be a member of the criminal justice system and thus have access to restricted information. It is therefore essential, from the outset, to evaluate methods for ensuring the confidentiality of the investigation.  \n \nSteps taken to protect the security of the investigations could include:  \na) Renting non-police or undercover locations and making them secure; \n \n 45b) Using fictitious names to purchase or rent equipment; and \nc) Using stand-alone computer systems not  linked to any other governmental \noperation. \n 3. Policy document \n \nIn addition to the TOR, a policy and procedures document should be maintained.  This should include a clear description of the facts giving rise to the investigation; all decisions taken during the investigation, along with their justifications; and the reasons \nfor the involvement or non-involvement of th e senior management of the institution for \nwhich the suspect works. There can be hidden costs in an investigation, such as loss of morale within the institution where the suspect works and a potential loss of public trust. Every major investigation must be evaluated on a case-by-case basis with regard to its cost and the benefits to the government and the public.  \nH.  DISPOSING CORRUPTION CASES \n \nCases where corruption on the part of individuals is identified can be dealt with in \nseveral ways:  \na)  By criminal or administrative prosec utions, leading to possible imprisonment, \nfines, restitution orders or other punishment; \nb) By disciplinary actions of an administrative nature, leading to possible \nemployment-related measures such  as dismissal or demotion; \nc)  By bringing or encouraging civil proceedings in which those directly affected (or \nthe State) seek to recover the proceeds of corruption or ask for civil damages; \nand, \nd)  Through remedial actions, such as the retraining of individuals or restructuring \nof operations in ways that reduce or eliminate opportunities for corruption (but without necessarily seeking to  discipline those involved). \n \nGenerally, the same detection techniques, investigative procedures and evidentiary \nrequirements will apply, regardless of the process chosen. However, because of the serious penal consequences facing convicted offenders, the evidence for criminal prosecutions will usually have to meet higher standards of reliability and probative value than is the case for administrative action. The decision as to whether to apply criminal sanctions or to seek less drastic remedi es can be an exceedingly difficult one. It must \nbalance moral and ethical considerations against pragmatic costs and benefits, and is \nitself, susceptible to corruption in systems where there are relatively broad areas of prosecutorial discretion.  Criminal prosecutions may be either not possible or undesirable in the following \ncircumstances: \n \n1. The conduct may not be a crime \n \nIn some cases, behaviour might be considered as being \"corrupt\" for the purposes of a \nnational anti-corruption programme or the internal codes of a company or government \nagency. But however unethical it may be, the conduct will not necessarily constitute a criminal offence. It may be a type of conduct that has been overlooked in the development of the criminal law, or be conduct (such as purely private-sector \n \n 46malfeasance) that is seen as corrupt but has been judged by the country’s legislators as \nnot being sufficiently harmful to the public interest as to warrant criminalization. \n \n2. Available evidence may not support prosecution  \nThe burden of proof in criminal prosecutions demands relatively high standards because of the penal consequences involved. In some cases, there may be sufficient evidence to justify lesser corrective measures but not to support a criminal prosecution. (Administrative sanctions do not usually require proof beyond reasonable doubt but only \non the balance of probabilities.)  \n Where the evidence in a particular case is insufficient, the authorities must generally decide whether the circumstances warrant the additional delay and expense needed to gather sufficient additional evidence so that criminal proceedings can be brought, or \nwhether disciplinary or other remedial actions should be pursued instead. One “cost \nfactor” in such cases is the cost of leaving a corrupt official in place long enough to complete a full criminal investigation where, for tactical reasons, he or she cannot be suspended while the investigation is taking place.  \n \n3. Prosecution may not be in the public interest  \nIn some cases, the conduct under examination may amount to a crime but the public interest is better served by some other course of action being followed. For instance, where large numbers of officials are involved,  the costs of prosecution include not only \nlitigation costs and the overloading of the court system to the detriment of other litigants.  \nDiscretionary decisions not to proceed to prosecution can be problematic. On the one \nhand, it may be very expensive to prosecute offenders on a case-by-case basis, but if a decision is made not to prosecute, it may create the impression that the justice system itself is corrupt, thus encouraging corruption in other sectors and seriously eroding any deterrence value in criminal justice measures. Where such a decision is made, it must \nbe well documented and made in the most transparent way possible so that any public \nperception of corruption in the investigation and prosecution processes is dispelled.  Criminal prosecutions and punishments can effectively remove corrupt officials from positions where they can commit further offences, and can deter the individuals involved and others in similar positions. Since much corruption is economic in nature, and is pre-\nplanned rather than spontaneous, general deterrence is likely to form a significant part of \nthe criminal justice component of anti-corruption strategies.    High financial and human costs impose practical limits on the extent of such \nprosecutions, however, and attempting large numbers of prosecutions as part of an anti-\ncorruption drive can have the consequence of creating pressures on investigators or prosecutors that lead them to bend the rules and so distort or corrupt the criminal justice system itself. In dealing with corruption, it  is always important to avoid creating any \nperverse incentives.  \nIn formulating anti-corruption strategies, criminal prosecution and punishment should be \nseen as only one of a series of options. Consideration should always be given to other possibilities, ranging from preventive measures (such as education and training) to \n \n 47administrative or disciplinary sanctions that  remove offenders more expeditiously and at \na lesser cost to the organisation and society as a whole.  \nArticle 30* \nProsecution, adjudication and sanctions \n1.

INTRODUCTION \n \nIt is a sobering thought that every corruption offence  represents a failure of some sort in a system designed to prevent corruption from occurring in the first place. Investigators and prosecutors are well placed to determine where the weak points are in the administrative systems of their own countries, and to take steps to see if these can be strengthened. They also have to live with the fact that such is human nature that \ncorruption can never be entirely eradicated. \n A key problem faced by those investigating corruption is detecting the fact that corruption has taken place. Unlike many tradi tional crimes, such as assault or theft, \ncorruption frequently does not have an obvious victim. There are no victims likely to \ncomplain. Furthermore, secrecy frequently surrounds corrupt activities so that  there are \nfew overt occurrences likely to be reported by witnesses, unless they are “insiders”.    However, corruption is decidedly not a \"victimless\" crime; the victim in many cases is the “public interest”. In the absence of an awareness of this, individuals are unlikely to risk the personal consequences, both professional and social, of reporting the \nmisdemeanors of their colleagues and, still less, those of their superiors. \n These present acute problems for the investig ator and prosecutor which are examined \nthroughout this Handbook. \n \nB.  PRO-ACTIVE AND REACTIVE DETECTION \n \nDetection can be broadly divided between pro-active and reactive detection.   \n Pro-active detection  takes place where a law enforcement agency initiates an \nundercover investigation in order to pursue intelligence it may have received possibly from an anonymous source, another agency or perhaps from a telephone interception.  \nThe principal feature  is that this form of detection is intelligence-based as opposed to \nbeing complaint-based.  A prime example of the pro-active approach is integrity testing, discussed in Chapter 11.  Reactive detection  takes place where a formal complaint is received by the law \nenforcement agency. These may come from the community, from government agencies, \nlocal councils or private companies.  They have as their core feature an official complaint \n(sometimes anonymous) which can form the bas is for investigation by an anti-corruption \norganisation.  Where the complaint comes from a government agency, it may be based on information derived from disclosure and r eporting requirements as well as audits and \ninspections.  \n \n 50 \nC.  IMPROVING REACTIVE DETECTION \n \nAlthough pro-active investigations can produce highly-successful outcomes, they can \nalso result in expensive failures, and in extreme cases can endanger the lives of \nundercover operatives and civilian informants.  Pro-active detections will usually \nrepresent only a small proportion of the operational work of an anti-corruption agency as experience suggests that the great bulk of investigations are complaint-based.   Increased reporting of instances of corruption can be fostered in a variety of ways. \nStrategies for public servants can include: \n \n-  Imposing obligations (backed up by disciplinary sanctions) on public servants to report all the instances of corruption that they observe. (Unfortunately, success with this approach has generally been elusive); -  Providing regular ethics training to public servants to improve standards of \nintegrity and decision-making in the workplace. (This can include “corruption \nsensitivity training” to render public servants more sensitive to corruption and more aware of situations and behaviour that can lead to corruption), and -  Providing whistleblower protection to complainants (discussed in Chapter 7). \n \nStrategies for the general public can cover: \n \n - Public awareness campaigns that convey anti-corruption messages and a belief \nthat the government is serious in its wish to combat corruption; \n - Educational programmes which incorporate into the school syllabus anti-\ncorruption awareness; \n - Engendering a high level of public confidence in the integrity and \nprofessionalism of anti-corruption law enforcement agencies in their handling of complaints.  One way in which to measure the level of public confidence in anti-corruption agencies is \nto compare the overall number of complaints received with the proportion that are not \nanonymous. \n \n1. Disclosure and reporting requirements \n \nRequiring public officials to make periodic di sclosures of their assets can increase both \nthe risks for corrupt officials and at the same time provide investigators with an \ninstrument with which to detect corruption. It is, of course, naive to expect corrupt officials to place their ill-gotten gains on the public record. However, they have to overcome hazards in concealing their illicit wealth, and where reporting failures do come to light these failures, by themselves, can be used to discipline officials without the need to find evidence of their corrupt acts. Comparisons of declared wealth with life-styles \ngive added teeth to this process. \n Where an official is not honest in complying with reporting requirements, more thorough investigations may be triggered, including an examination of possible conflict of interest situations. The official may ultimately be held to be liable not only for non-compliance \nwith a reporting obligation, but for corruption itself. \n \n 51 \nDisclosure and reporting requirements can also provide a valuable check for conflicts of interest situations. \n \nTo deter corrupt officials from trying to avoid liability for corruption by committing less serious disclosure and reporting offences, sanctions for non-disclosure or false reporting should be severe. They should always give rise to the prospect of dismissal. Thus a corrupt pattern of behaviour can be brought to an end even where inadequate disclosure has been successful in concealing the underlying corruption.  \n \nRegular periodic disclosure is essential (rather than simply requiring disclosure on taking up and leaving office) as this may allow a pattern of corruption to be detected and terminated while it is still taking place.   \nThe categories of officials required to make disclosures can be limited to those in \npositions of higher risk, rather than have a blanket requirement imposed on the whole public service and create needless administrative burdens.  \n \n2. Public Audits and inspections \n \nPublic audits and inspections include audits of records, physical inspections of premises and assets, as well as interviews with me mbers of the public and others who might have \nrelevant information.  This process can be used proactively by managers and \ninvestigators, as a means of monitoring the quality and integrity of public administration and identifying possible abuse. Inspections and audits can also be used reactively, as a \nmeans of investigating those already suspected of corruption or other malfeasance.  \n Audits may be conducted on an internal or local basis, but overall anti-corruption strategies should provide for a central, national audit agency with adequate resources and expertise. In order to audit senior leve ls of government, the agency must enjoy a \nsubstantial degree of autonomy, approaching or even equal to that of judicial \nindependence. This independence should extend to decisions about which officials, sectors or functions should be audited, how audits should be carried out, the formulation of conclusions about the results of audits and, to some degree, the publication or release of such conclusions.   \nThe agency should be required to report to the legislature rather than to the executive \nwhose affairs it inspects.  Auditors should have the power to conduct regular or random audits to provide overall deterrence and surveillance. They should also spec ifically target individuals or agencies \nsuspected of malfeasance. In many countries, their mandate goes beyond suspected \nmalfeasance, as auditors are also responsible for identifying and addressing cases of waste or inefficiency deriving from problems other than crime or corruption. Where problems are identified, auditors generally have the power to recommend administrative \nor legal reforms to address institutional or structural problems, and can refer cases to \nlaw enforcement agencies if criminal wrongdoing is suspected. \n \nAuditors should be supported by legal powers that require individuals or agencies being audited to cooperate, and they should have rights of access to bank records. They should not themselves become law enforcement agencies. In most countries, once \n \n 52criminal offences are suspected, higher standards of procedural safeguards are applied \nto protect the human rights of those involved and criminal investigations can involve the use of more coercive powers to gather evidence and to detain suspects. Auditors, too, \nhave a broader mandate, in that they are often concerned with addressing wider \nconcerns, such as value for money and government efficiency. \n \n3. Integrity testing \n \n Acts of “petty corruption”, in particular, c an be extremely difficult to prove. Integrity \ntesting is a way of overcoming this problem, but it does have to be conducted very \ncarefully.   The object is to \"test\" the integrity of an official, not to try to render an honest one corrupt through a process of entrapment. Most countries have \"agent provocateur\" rules in their \ncriminal codes, which act as a judicial check on what is permissible and what is not. \nThese rules vary from jurisdiction to jurisdic tion, but they obviously have to be borne in \nmind. It is important to ensure that the degree of temptation is not extreme and that the test is one that an objective bystander would assess as being basically fair and reasonable. The technique of integrity testing is discussed in detail in Chapter 11. \n \n4.  Opportunities to report corruption \n \nBefore corruption can be reported, it first must be identified. Thus, the general population and specific target groups may need to be educated as to what constitutes corruption. This would cover the full range of corruption types, the true costs and consequences of \ncorruption and, more generally, the wider benefits to all of high standards of integrity in \npublic administration and private business alike.   Many people have a very narrow appreciation of corruption and do not always understand that certain types of behaviour are not “fair game” but can be harmful. \nOthers may understand the harm but lack either the motivation or the confidence to \nreport it. This can be because they see the problem as pervasive and resistant to change, or because they view the complaints mechanisms as being unreliable, or even dangerous to use. More usually, there is a fear of the social consequences of reporting the illicit activities of colleagues. In environments where corruption has become \ninstitutionalized and accepted, considerable educational efforts will be needed if the \npopular perception that corruption is a natural or inevitable phenomenon is to be \nchanged. It must be recognised as being socially harmful, morally wrong and, in most cases, a crime.   Managers in the public service must be required to assume responsibility for dealing with \ncorruption in the activities for which they are responsible. They must know what they \nshould do when cases arise and be \"visible\" so that those likely to report corruption are aware of their existence and can readily cont act them with information. Although minor \nincidents can often be handled by responsible managers internally, there should be clear procedures to be followed when serious instances of corruption arise.  In particular, managers should be discouraged from trying to conduct major investigations \nthemselves. Professional investigators are trained in interviewing witnesses and in the \nrecording and preservation of evidence; public service managers are not. \n                                            \n   \n \n 53  \n5. Security against retribution \n Victims and witnesses cannot be expected to come forward if they have reason to fear \npossible retribution. Precautions against retribution are commonly incorporated into instruments dealing with corruption and organized crime, especially where the problem is acute. This is particularly true in cases of official corruption. Those who have information are often subordinates of a corrupt official, and the status of the corrupt official can afford  opportunities to retaliate. To facilitate complaints against superior line \nmanagers, some countries enable government agencies to appoint an outside \norganisation to serve as the first recipient of complaints made by their staff.   Measures are usually formulated to protect not only the informant but also the integrity and confidentiality of the investigation. In order to prevent intimidation and any tampering \nwith an investigation, common precautions include guarantees of anonymity for an \ninformant; measures to prevent officials under  investigation for corruption from having \nany access to investigative personnel, files or records; and the power to suspend or transfer a suspected official during the course of an investigation.   \nIn these cases, where the informant is an \"insider\", additional precautions may be \nneeded. Many countries have adopted \"whistleblower\" laws and procedures to protect insiders in both the public and private sectors who come forward with information. Additional protection may include shielding an informant from civil litigation in areas such defamation and possible breaches of confidentiality agreements. There may also be a need to safeguard public officials from criminal liability for the disclosure of official \nsecrets (e.g. where corruption in defence procurements is reported).  \n Protection should also extend to cases where the information is ultimately proved to be wrong, provided the informants have acted in good faith. It has to be said, however, that even those whistleblowers regarded by the public as “heroes” tend to pay a very high \nprice for their courage.  Non-governmental organisations can sometimes assist  by \nensuring that potential whistleblowers are aware of the risks they are assuming, and that they present their complaints in the most effective way.\n19 \n On the other hand, safeguards may also be needed where informants act in bad faith, particularly in cases where they are permitted to retain their anonymity or are shielded \nfrom legal liability. To balance the interest s involved, some countries limit legal \nprotection to cases of disclosures made in good faith, or create civil or criminal liability \nfor cases where the informant has acted in bad faith or where the belief that malfeasance had occurred was not based on reasonable grounds.  \nIn cases where the information proves to be valid and triggers official action, the \nanonymity of the informant cannot always be maintained, making retribution a possibility. Legislation may provide for compensation or for the transfer of the informant to another agency.  If an informant is in serious danger, relocation and a new identity unknown to the offenders may be needed under a witness protection scheme (these are discussed \n                                            \n19  An example in the UK is Public Concern At Work: http://www.pcaw.co.uk/  Public Concern at Work is \nan independent authority on whistleblowing. It provides free help to prospective whistleblowers, advises on \nwhistleblowing laws and helps organisations create a cult ure where it is safe and accepted for staff to blow \nthe whistle.  \n \n 54in Chapter 6). However, legislation has its limits and it is not always as effective in \nproviding protection for whistleblowers as many would like it to be. \n \n6.  Exchanging information with other investigative agencies   \n \nGiven the need for autonomy and independence on the part of investigators, and taking into account the extreme sensitivity of many corruption cases, care must be taken when establishing relationships between anti-corruption (criminal) bodies and other government agencies (e.g. internal inspection  and audit within government agencies). In \nenvironments where corruption is believed to be widespread, complete autonomy is \nadvisable. Nonetheless, it will always be important for anti-corruption investigators to interact effectively with other official entities. For example, information from tax authorities or agencies investigating money-laundering or other economic crimes may uncover evidence of corruption or of unexplained wealth that may have been derived \nfrom corruption.  Audits of government agencies may disclose inefficiencies or \nmalfeasance that is not tantamount to corruption but warrants the attention of other agencies.  Criminal investigators should be able to pass these matters on to them.  \n \n 55D. CHAPTER 4; QUESTIONS FOR DISCUSSION \n \n4.1 Are there set rules of procedure for criminal and civil law in your country? Do \nthese provide for immunities for certain categories of official? Are any \nimmunities capable of being waived? Is this an appropriately simple procedure? \nAre immunities in your country abused? If so, what is the evidence for this? What reforms might such abuses make necessary? \n 4.2 In your criminal and civil rules of procedure are there deadlines within which \nyou must file a complaint, present the complaint to the defendant, present all \nevidence to the court? Are these time limits reasonable? Do they work to \nprotect the corrupt? Or do they work to protect the innocent from late allegations that they may have difficulty in refuting because of the passage of time? \n \n4.3 Are you required to share any of the evidence gathered in the investigation your \ncase with opposing counsel where this is not being presented to the court? \n \n4.4 If a judgment is entered against a defendant, does he have the right to appeal \nto a higher reviewing court? \n \n4.5 Is the judge bound to give a written decision in order to provide for consistency?  \nDoes the written decision have to show logical progression while following precedent and statutory law? Does it have to be published? \n \n4.6 What general incentives are offered to witnesses and other persons in assisting \nin investigations? \n \n4.7 Is there any non-governmental authority which monitors or enforces \nprofessional standards among members of the legal profession in general? Does this extend to lawyers in the public service? \n \n4.8 Does your country’s constitution guar antee a “fair trial” in criminal matters? \nWhat are the implications for this in the way in which you perform your functions? Does it make any difference if you are performing the role of a prosecutor or you are performing the role of a defender? \n \n4.9 In what ways do you think the role of the investigator/prosecutor and the role of \ndefence lawyers differ? \n \n4.10 If in the course of an investigation you find evidence that would be helpful to the \ndefence, what should you do?  If there is something you should consider doing,  \nwhen should you do it ? \n \n4.11 What do you personally believe to be the values that an investigator/prosecutor \nshould be seeking to uphold? \n \n \n 56CHAPTER 5 \n \n \nGATHERING AND USE OF EVIDENCE \n \n A.  LEGAL PROVISIONS TO FACILI TATE THE GATHERING AND USE OF \nEVIDENCE IN CORRUPTION CASES.  \n \n \nIn terms of being a practical tool, the below my suffice. In the interest of keeping the \nHandbook short, I would suggest the deletion of the above.  \n \n1. Measures which expedite the gathering and production of evidence  \n \nWhile the basic burden of proof rests on the prosecution and applies in all criminal cases, changes may be made to expedite the gathering and production of the evidence \nneeded for prosecutors to meet that burden. Legislation may increase investigative \npowers or simplify the requirements for admission of evidence in proceedings. Increasingly, the law must deal with evidence stored or transmitted using electronic information and communications technologies, as well as more traditional issues, such as bank secrecy and similar laws or practi ces. Generally, powers whose exercise is \nbased on suspicions of crime having taken place or are used in support of a criminal \ninvestigation are subject to additional safeguards, but more routine powers of audit or personal disclosure requirements which may apply to all public servants regardless of any suspicion may also be considered. These may be supplemented by criminal offences for conduct such as making false disclosures or obstructing inspections or \naudits such that corrupt officials, who fail to comply with transparency requirements that \nwould expose corrupt conduct, may be prosecuted for the disclosure offences instead.   \n2. The  use of non-criminal proceedings  \n \nThe basic presumption of innocence and the high onus of proving guilt beyond a \nreasonable doubt applies only in criminal cases. The International Covenant on Civil and \nPolitical Rights and other international and regional human rights instruments as well as national human rights protections refer only to cases where someone is “…charged with a criminal offence…” however, there are vari ations with respect to how this should be \ninterpreted.  \n \nThe narrow interpretation is that the presumption would not apply in proceedings prior to the laying of charges, and would not apply to cases where there were no charges or prosecution, even if criminal or quasi-crimi nal punishments, such as the confiscation of \nproperty, might be applied. The broader interpretation would extend the presumption to all procedures or proceedings, which might lead  to criminal or quasi-criminal sanctions, \nincluding both of these scenarios. Thus, in some countries, it may be possible to use \nnon-criminal proceedings, and a lower burden of proof, than in others.  Some types of these non-criminal proceedings include the following. \n \n \n \n 57 \na. Civil or preventive forfeiture of corruption proceeds  \nA lower, balance-of-probabilities standard of proof may be used where allowed by domestic constitutional or other requirement s in any case where remedies are being \nsought but where no one has been actually charged with the commission of a crime. This approach may also be used if the remedy of recovering assets is fashioned in such a way that it amounts to the civil recovery of wrongfully obtained assets and their return to their rightful owners, as opposed to a form of criminal punishment. Precisely how this distinction is made will generally depend on th e formulation of domestic human rights \nand procedural principles, and how officials and the courts apply these in practice. The \nuse of civil or preventive proceedings is also a significant issue in international \ncooperation, as some countries allow the broad use of such proceedings and remedies, while others limit their use in order to ensure that they are not used to circumvent or avoid the human rights safeguards which apply to criminal proceedings. \n \nCountries such as Italy \n20, Ireland 21 and the United States 22 provide, under varying \nconditions, for the possibility of civil or prevent ive confiscation of assets suspected to be \nderived from certain criminal activity. Unlike confiscation in criminal proceedings, such forfeiture laws do not require proof of illicit origin \"beyond reasonable doubt\". Instead, they consider proof on a balance of probabilities or demand a high probability of illicit \norigin combined with the inability of the owner to prove the contrary. \n In one case, the European Human Rights Commission and the European Human Rights Courts were called upon to review the consistency of this provision with the principle of \nthe presumption of innocence\n.23 Based on three criteria for determining the criminal \nnature of a provision, namely the classification of the proceedings under national law, \ntheir essential nature, and the type and severity of the penalty, the Commission \nconcluded that the confiscation, which is cla ssified as preventive measure, did not have \nthe degree of severity of a criminal sanction. The Commission assigned particular relevance to the fact that (i) the confiscation did not imply a judgment of guilt, but rather that of the social danger of the respondent, based on the well-founded suspicion of his participation in a Mafia-type organization and (ii) it was applied only to such properties, \nthat on a balance of probabilities had been found to derive from illicit sources.\n24  \n \n                                            \n20 Art. 2ter Italian Law No.575/ 1965, provides for the se izure of property, owned directly or indirectly by any \nperson suspected of participating in a Mafia-type a ssociation, when its value appears to be out of all \nproportion to his or her income or economic activiti es, or when it can be reasonably argued, based on the \navailable evidence, that the said property constitutes t he proceeds of unlawful activities. The seized property \nbecomes subject to confiscation if no satisfactory ex planation can be provided for its lawful origin. \n21 According to the Proceeds of Crime Act 1996 of Ir eland the High Court upon application can seize assets \nthat are suspected to be derived from criminal activity . Seizure can be ordered without prior conviction or \nproof of criminal activity on the part of the (civil) respon dent, who, to defeat the claim, is required to establish \nthe innocent origins of his suspicious and hitherto unexplained wealth. \n22 The US Forfeiture Laws introduced the concept of \"civil action\" against the property itself, which allows \nfor proofing the illicit origin on a balance of probabilities. \n23 European Human Rights Commission, No. 12386/ 1986 \n24 With regard to the property right as provided by Art. 1 Protocol No. 1 to the European Human Rights \nConvention, the European Human Rights Court affirmed th e proportionality of the pr eventive confiscation as \nan instrument in the fight against the Mafia. \n \n 58 \nArticle 31* \nFreezing, seizure and confiscation25 \n1. Each State Party shall take, to the greatest extent possible within its domestic legal system, \nsuch measures as may be necessary to enable confiscation of: \n(a) Proceeds of crime derived from offences established in accordance with  this Convention or \nproperty the value of which corres ponds to that of such proceeds; \n(b) Property, equipment or other instrumentalit ies used in or destined for use in offences \nestablished in accordance with this Convention. \n2. Each State Party shall take such measures as may be necessary to enable the identification, \ntracing, freezing or seizure of any item referred to  in paragraph 1 of this article for the purpose of \neventual confiscation. \n3. Each State Party shall adopt, in accordance wi th its domestic law, such legislative and other \nmeasures as may be necessary to regulate the administration by the competent authorities of \nfrozen, seized or confiscated property cover ed in paragraphs 1 and 2 of this article. \n4. If such proceeds of crime have been transformed or converted, in part or in full, into other \nproperty, such property shall be liable to the meas ures referred to in this article instead of the \nproceeds. \n5. If such proceeds of crime have been intermin gled with property acquired from legitimate \nsources, such property shall, without prejudice to any powers relating to freezing or seizure, be \nliable to confiscation up to the assessed  value of the intermingled proceeds. \n6. Income or other benefits derived from such proc eeds of crime, from property into which such \nproceeds of crime have been transformed or co nverted or from property with which such \nproceeds of crime have been intermingled shall also be liable to the measures referred to in this \narticle, in the same manner and to the same extent as proceeds of crime. \n7. For the purpose of this article and article 55  of this Convention, each State Party shall \nempower its courts or other competent authoritie s to order that bank, financial or commercial \nrecords be made available or seized. A State Party shall not decline to act under the provisions of \nthis paragraph on the ground of bank secrecy. \n8. States Parties may consider the possibility of requiring that an offender demonstrate the lawful \norigin of such alleged proceeds of crime or other pr operty liable to confiscation, to the extent that \nsuch a requirement is consistent with the fundam ental principles of their domestic law and with \nthe nature of judicial and other proceedings. \n9. The provisions of this article shall not be so construed as to prejudice the rights of bona fide \nthird parties. \n10. Nothing contained in this article shall affect th e principle that the measures to which it refers \nshall be defined and implemented in accordance with and subject to the provisions of the \ndomestic law of a State Party. \n \n*UN CONVENTION AGAINST CORRUPTION  \n \nb. The use of regulatory, administrative or disciplinary proceedings  \nWhile the presumption of innocence and a high standard of proof apply to cases \ninvolving a “criminal” offence, many coun tries have administrative or regulatory \nmeasures which are similar to criminal ones but which do not lead to criminal \npunishments, and which are often limited in th eir application to specific categories of \nnatural or legal persons.  Where private-sector bribery is not made a crime, for example, administrative offences and punishments es tablished for the purpose of regulating \ncompanies or financial markets might still apply – and on the basis of proof on the balance of probabilities.  Regulations or standards of practice for public servants or \n                                            \n25  For a further discussion, see “Criminal confiscation”, Case Study# 33, and “Property Penalty”, Case \nStudy# 34,  UNODC Anti-Corruption T oolkit, Second Edition, February 2004; \nhttp://www.unodc.org:80/pd f/crime/corruption/toolkit/AC_Toolkit_Edition2.pdf  \n \n 59regulated professions, such as law, might also include offences and sanctions for corrupt \nconduct which could lead to professional discipline, discharge or removal of practicing privileges, again proved on the balance of probabilities.  \n \n3.  The use of a reduced burden of proof in specific elements of criminal \nproceedings \nIn some legal systems, after the basic legal burden of proof has been discharged, \ncertain facts may be presumed to the advantage of the State.26 \n \na. Criminal forfeiture of assets on a reduced burden of proof   \nOne example , which commonly arises allows the proceeds of crime to be traced, seized \nand forfeited based on a reduced standard of proof, once someone has been convicted of a crime. Where provided by law, such mechanisms may be useful for recovering the proceeds of corruption, but they usually cannot be used to establish criminal guilt or \nimpose sanctions other than the recovery of proceeds. The most common scenario is \nwhere the crime is proved in proceedings whic h lead to the conviction of offenders.  In \ncases where the offenders are deceased, out of  the jurisdiction or cannot be prosecuted \nfor other reasons, some countries’ laws  allow for confiscation, without any prosecution, where there is proof that an offence has occurred and that the targeted assets are \nproceeds  \n \nWhile the formulation of such provisions differ,\n27 most of them are based on the \nconcept that the property and pecuniary resources of persons convicted of certain \ncrimes should be presumed to be derived from criminal activities unless he or she is \nwilling to produce a satisfactory explanation of their lawful origin. The \"burden of providing a satisfactory explanation\" only becomes effective once the prosecution has \nestablished that the offender is in direct or indirect control of monies, property or other \npecuniary resources which appear to be out of all proportions when compared to his income. Only at this stage the offender is requested to provide an explanation, which, if \nsatisfactory, places the burden of proof once again upon the prosecution\n.28 Some \ncountries narrow the proposition further and require that the prosecution establish guilt of \na criminal offence beyond reasonable doubt before the presumption of illicit wealth can \nbe invoked.  \n \nAs far as courts have been called upon to review such provisions, they have found them \nin consistency with the presumption of innocence. 29 For example, the European Court \n                                            \n26  For a further discussion, see “Meeting the burden of  proof in corruption-related proceedings”, Tool \n# 37, UNODC Anti-Corruption Toolkit, Second Edition, February 2004; \nhttp://www.unodc.org:80/pd f/crime/corruption/toolkit/AC_Toolkit_Edition2.pdf  \n27 E.g Art. 12 para 7 of the TOC Convention calls upon State Parties to consider the possibility of requiring \nthat an offender demonstrates the lawf ul origin of alleged proceeds of crime or other property liable to \nconfiscation, to the extent that such  a requirement is consistent with t he principles of their domestic law and \nwith the nature of the judicial and other proceedings.  \n28 Examples of such provisions in national laws in clude Art. 12sexies Italian Law No. 356/ 1992; Section 4 \nSingapore Confiscation of Benefits Act; Section 12A Hong Kong Prevention of Bribery Ordinance; Art. 34a \nNorwegian General Civil Penal Code; Art. 78d German Criminal Code; Art. 36 and 40 Kenyan Narcotic \nDrugs and Psychotropic Substances Act. No.4/ 1994; Ar t. 8 Japanese Anti-Drug Special Law and the Art. 72 \nAA UK Criminal Justice Act 1988, as amended by the Drug Trafficking Act 1994.  \n29 The Italian Constitutional Court and Court of Cassati on had to consider whether Art. 12sexies of the Law \n356/ 1992 did comply with the presumption of innoc ence as provided by the Italian Constitution. Art. \n12sexies establishes, in case of conviction for certai n serious criminal offences, mandatory confiscation of \nall monies, property and other pecuniary resources, whic h are under the direct or indirect control of the \n \n 60for Human Rights examined the consistency of a confiscation under UK Drug legislation \nwith Art. 6 para 2 European Human Rights Convention. 30 The key question for the court \nregarding the applicability of Art. 6 para 2 to the confiscation proceedings was whether \nthe prosecutor's application for a confisca tion order following the accused's conviction \namounted to the bringing of a new \"charge\" within the meaning of the Article. While the \nCourt recognized that implicitly the 1994 Act required the national court to assume that the defendant had been involved in other unlawful drug-related activity prior to the offence of which he was convicted, it affirmed that the application of confiscation under the UK Drug Trafficking Act 1994 did not involve any new charge, since the purpose of this procedure was not the conviction or acquittal of the applicant. Hence it could not be \nconcluded that the applicant was being charged with a criminal offence beyond the one \nof which he had already been found guilty. \n \nb. Criminal offences in which some elements are presumed against the accused \nA second common example is the establishment of criminal offences in which, once some elements are proven, others may be presumed against the accused in the \nabsence of proof to the contrary. The most common use of such measures in anti-corruption legislation is the creation of the offence of illicit enrichment. By this (significant) unexplained wealth is presum ed to have been illicitly acquired once the \nbasic acquisition of the wealth is proved and is shown to be disproportionate in relation \nto the known means of the accused. The accused must then produce an explanation for \nthe lawful origin of the wealth (either an explanation that is simply “credible” or else established on the balance of probabilities). In systems where as set-disclosure is \nmandatory, for example, proof that a public servant had more wealth than he or she had declared would result in conviction for illicit enrichment unless the accused public servant could establish a legitimate source for the wealth.   \n \nSuch provisions are unquestionably effective, and are based on the policy that the person in possession of the wealth is in the best possible position to produce evidence of how it was acquired, but in some countries they are thought to infringe the right to remain silent. In other countries the provisions are regarded as being valid, and the \ndifference depends to a large degree on how the right to the presumption of innocence is \ninterpreted and applied in each country.\n31  \n \n                                                                                                                                  \noffender, when their value appears to be out of all proportions to his income and he is unwilling or unable to \nprovide a satisfactory explanation. Both courts c oncluded that the presumpt ion of innocence was not \napplicable to Art. 12sexies Law. 356/ 1992. According to  the courts, the purpose of the provision was not to \nsanction the offender, but rather to prevent the fi nancing future criminal activities (Cassazione Penale, \nSezione VI, 15 April 1996 and Corte Costituzionale, Ordi nanza N. 18/1996). The House of Lords in Regina \nv. Rezvi had to consider whether the various assumption s contained in Section 72 AA of the Criminal Justice \nAct 1988, were compatible with the presumption of innocence. Art. 72 AA provides for the assumption that \nany property appearing to the court to be held by or tr ansferred to the defendant at the date of the conviction \nwas received by him as a result of or in connection with  the commission of offences to which this act applies. \nThe key issue to be examined by the Lords was, whet her the confiscation order based on Art. 72AA implied \nthat the offender had committed ot her crimes besides the one he had been found guilty of. The Lords \nconcluded that confiscation was a  \"financial penalty \" imposed for the offence of which the offender has \nbeen convicted and involved no accusation of any other offence. (see also McIntosh v. Lord Advocate, 2001 \nand Regina v. Benjafield 2000).  \n30  European Court of Human Rights, Ca se of Phillips v. the UK, No. 41087/1998 \n31 Following the Art. IX of the OAS Corruption C onvention, most of the American Countries have \nestablished the (mere) possession of unexplained weal th as a criminal offence, while the US and Canada \ndid to comply on the grounds, that the offence of illicit enrichment wo uld place the burden of proof on the \ndefendant and, therefore, be contrary to the presumption of innocence.  \n \n 61One line of interpretation holds that the right to be presumed innocent overall includes \nthe right to be presumed innocent on each essential element of an offence.  In this model it is argued that safeguards are needed to ensure that the innocent are not \nconvicted and to prevent legislatures from  rendering trials unfair through  overturning \ndifficult areas of proof or from converting difficult investigative or evidentiary problems \ninto offence elements which are presumed against the accused.\n32  The other line of \napproach holds that, once the basic core elements of an offence have been proved \nbeyond a reasonable doubt, this effectively raises an evidentiary burden to rebut prosecution evidence and to prove additional facts against the prosecution. In this model, once it is proved that the accused public official has wealth, which exceeds all \nlegitimate known sources, an evidentiary burden then may be imposed on him or her to \nshow that it was obtained from legitimate, and not illicit, sources.\n33   \n \nIn some cases, the constitutional or legal viability of reversed or diminished burdens of proof will depend on the relationship between what must be proved by the prosecution and what must then be proved by the accused. If there is some factual link such that, \nonce the prosecution’s case is proved, there is little or no rational explanation other than \nthe guilt of the accused, the presumption is more than likely to be upheld\n.34 In the case \nof illicit enrichment offences, this would apply where the legislation and proceedings \nwere structured so as to eliminate all possible legitimate sources of wealth before proven enrichment was presumed to derive from illicit sources.  \n                                            \n32 E.g. R. v. Vaillancourt  [1987] 2 S.C.R. 636 at 656, and R. v. Whyte  [1988] 2 S.C.R. 3.   In both, the \nCanadian Supreme Court holds that the right to the presumption of innocence under Art. 11(d) of that \ncountry’s Charter of Rights and Freedoms  extends to each essential element  of the offence, and that this \nrule must be applied in such a way that a person accu sed of a crime cannot be c onvicted if there remains \nany reasonable doubt about innocence or guilt. \n33 This approach was followed by the U.K. Judicial Co mmittee of the Privy Council in a 1993 appeal from \nHong Kong ( Attorney General of Hong Kong v. Lee Kwong-kut  [1993] A.C. 951). The Privy Council, \nexamined whether Section 10 of the Hong Kong Bill of Rights Ordinance 1991 had entrenched the \npresumption of innocence by providin g that any present or former public  servant, who maintains a standard \nof living above that which is commensur ate with his present or past official  emoluments; or is in control of \npecuniary resources or property disproportionate to hi s present or past official emoluments, shall be guilty, \nunless he gives 'a satisfactory explanation' to the court as to how he was able to maintain such a standard of \nliving or how such pecuniary resources or property came  under his control. The Court held that Section 10 \ncasts a burden of proving the absence of corruption upon a defendant. But before prosecution had to prove \nbeyond reasonable doubt the accused’s public servant  status, his standard of living during the charge \nperiod, his total official emoluments during that period,  and that his standard of living could not reasonably, \nin all the circumstances, have been afforded out of hi s total official emoluments. The court observed that \nwhere corruption is concerned, there was a need – within  reason – for special powers of investigation and \nan explanation requirement. Specific corrupt acts were inherently difficult to detect, let alone proved in the \nnormal way. Accordingly, section 10 was found consis tent with the constituti onal guarantee of the \npresumption of innocence. It was dictated by nece ssity and went no further than necessary (Attorney \nGeneral v. Lee Kwong-kut, 1993, AC 951). \n34. In the Salabiuka Case the European Human Right s Court examined whether the French Customs Code \n(Art. 414, 417 and 392) infringed t he presumption of innocence as provided by Art. 6 para. 2 ECHR \n(Salabiuka v. France  [1987] ECHR, Case No. 14/1987). As app lied by the French courts, these norms \nprovide that any person in possession of goods, which he or she has brought into France without declaring \nthem to customs is presumed to be legally liable un less he or she can prove a specific event of force \nmajeure exculpating him and shall, t herefore, be guilty of the offence of smuggling. The Court affirmed that \nin principle, State Parties to the European Hum an Rights Convention may, under certain conditions, \npenalize a simple objective fact as such. The Europe an Human Rights Convention cl early does not prohibit \npresumptions of law or fact in principle. It does, howe ver, require the Contracting States to remain within \ncertain limits as regards criminal law. Art. 6 para 2 of the Convention does not regard presumptions of fact or \nof law provided for in the criminal law with indifference.  It requires States to confine them within reasonable \nlimits, which take into account the importance of what is at stake and maintain the rights of defence.  \n \n 62There can be no doubt that the offence of “illicit enrichment” can be a valuable tool in \nfighting corruption. Low-level customs officers may be driving late model Mercedes that they could not conceivably have acquired through their earned income. Given that they \nare in positions where they can take bribes , the assumption would be that the officers \nhave enriched themselves illicitly , unless they can show that they have won a lottery or \nperhaps inherited wealth from a rich relation.  \nArticle 20* \nIllicit enrichment 35 \nSubject to its constitution and the fundamental pr inciples of its legal system, each State Party \nshall consider adopting such legislative and other measures as may be necessary to establish as \na criminal offence, when committed intentionally, illicit enrichment, that  is, a significant increase in \nthe assets of a public official that he or she c annot reasonably explain in relation to his or her \nlawful income. \n \n*UN CONVENTION AGAINST CORRUPTION  \n                                            \n35  For further discussion, see “Illicit enrichment”,  Case Study# 32; UNODC Anti-Corruption Toolkit, \nSecond Edition, February 2004; \nhttp://www.unodc.org:80/pd f/crime/corruption/toolkit/AC_Toolkit_Edition2.pdf  \n \n 63H.

INTRODUCTION \n Corruption investigations require the identification of individuals who are in a position to assist in an investigation by providing information about a corrupt official and his or her activities. Successful law enforcement investigators must be experienced in the identification and handling of witnesses (who may have reported a single instance of \ncorrupt conduct) and “sources” (able to provide information on a continuing basis). This \nplaces a heavy onus on  investigators to  exercise good judgment in managing the \nactivities of sources and witnesses and to have appropriate procedures for the processing of the information they provide and, if necessary, for protecting their identity.  Given the consensual and secretive nature of many corruption offences, in the majority \nof cases persons who have information about them fail to report it to the police, because \nthey fear the consequences and because they might incriminate themselves. This is as \ntrue of the public sector as it is in the world of private business.  Some countries are introducing compulsory reporting obligations for corruption offences \ndirected at categories of persons such as auditors, public officials and supervisory \nauthorities. Where there is such a duty to report, it is most likely to be effective if there are rules providing protection from adverse consequences for those who fulfil their obligations.   \n \nInformation sources represent an extraordi narily powerful investigative tool for \ninvestigators facing the challenge of major corruption cases. Investigative responsibilities when using sources require that law enforcement agencies establish internal protocols and procedures to minimise the possibilities for misunderstandings.   A comprehensive interviewing strategy should be designed. This should include \nmeasures to cope with obstructive lawyers, to  provide witness protection, to protect the \ncredibility of the witness and to reduce any opportunities there may be for defence \nlawyers to attack the propriety of the management of a witness. The best way to avoid allegations of illegal enquiry methods or  promises made to witnesses by the \ninvestigating team is to record all interviews electronically. \n \nWitnesses may themselves have a criminal background that renders them less credible. \nIf investigators are to be able to counter this, witnesses need to be open with them about their involvement in prior criminal acts, particularly if these include acts of corruption for which suspects are being investigated. Nothing is more damaging to a prosecutor’s case than to have an important witness exposed as a criminal for the first time in cross-\nexamination before a trial judge or jury. The criminal background of any such witness \nshould be disclosed to the court at an early stage in the proceedings, and certainly before the witness is submitted to cross-examination.   \n \n 65Witnesses must be protected from threats. The level of protection provided will vary \ndepending on the nature and extent of the individuals’ cooperation with law enforcement and the degree of risk to which they are exposed. Many may require little or no \nprotection after reporting acts of petty corruption. Others, unfortunately, may need much. \n The most cost-effective means of providing protection is to keep the identity of witnesses confidential for as long as possible. However, at the extreme end of the scale, witness protection programmes may be needed. These can include temporary financial assistance to witnesses and the establishment of new identities for them. Formal witness \nprotection programmes often include the temporary or permanent relocation of a witness \nor victim. These relocations may need to include family members, and usually require direct financial assistance to the witness during an initial, and often prolonged, period of relocation. New identities are sometimes created for a witness, who is expected to sever all ties with his or her former community.  \n \nThe very great stress and personal costs of a formal relocation are such that a psychological assessment of a witness (and, if relevant, members of his or her immediate family) should be made to determine whether they are capable of withstanding the pressures of a relocation programme. It is not uncommon for witnesses, \nin spite of personal danger, to return to their familiar haunts because of an inability to \ncope with the change. On the other hand, some witnesses are able to adapt easily to a new life and identity, and can be successful participants in witness protection programmes.   Effective witness protection does not always require relocation. Some witness \nassistance may be very short term, and in the form of a temporary hotel stay. Assistance \nmay be limited to police escorts to and from judicial proceedings, or a guard being placed on a home. Where it is necessary for a witness to move to another location, but can safely retain his or her identity, law enforcement agency representatives can help witnesses to contact available government or  private social services to facilitate \ntemporary housing and to secure employment. Witnesses who are in prison may need to \nbe separated securely from the general prison population.   Any necessary protection methods should be in place during all stages of a criminal proceeding. However, the critical periods for witnesses are usually at the time of an arrest and during the court hearing. Once a conviction has been obtained, the threat \nusually, but not always, diminishes.  By then any harm to a witness would be a matter of \nstraightforward revenge, rather than an attempt to prevent the witness from giving evidence at the trial.   Maintaining the confidence of a witness is of the highest importance. The mere \nwillingness of an investigator to keep witnesses informed of the progress of a criminal \nprosecution can help allay fears and apprehension. This not only serves to instil confidence in the witness that he or she has not been “abandoned”, but can also help the witness the better to adapt to the protective measures being taken on his or her behalf.   \nWorking with witnesses requires special skills and the law enforcement investigator \nshould expect to encounter difficulties. Some cooperating witnesses attempt to disrupt the overall investigative strategy of a case to further their own personal goals – as frequently a witness will have a personal agenda that their complaint is intended to \n \n 66promote. Efforts to conceal the identity of confidential informants may not be successful, \nresulting in a serious breach of the informant’s expectations of the law enforcement agency. It can also be that some witnesses provide false information, or exaggerate \nfacts, after an investigator has become reliant on their truthfulness.  \n \nB.  INFORMANTS AND OTHER SOURCES \n Information sources can be classified by the nature and extent of the cooperation they provide to investigators. Generally, they divide into three categories: “confidential sources”, “confidential informants”, and “cooperating witnesses”. Distinguishing between \nthe types of sources can facilitate the internal administration of an investigative agency.   \n Confidential informants  are likely to be persons who are themselves engaged in criminal \nactivities or associated with persons who are. Confidential informants are often paid by law enforcement agencies and their relationship with investigators is expected to be a \ncontinuing one. Their status as an informant, and the information they provide, are kept \nabsolutely confidential and thus (unlike a cooperating witness) they are not expected to testify in court or otherwise participate publicly in any prosecution.   The various motivations for someone to act as a confidential informant include revenge, \nfinancial gain, or the desire to further a beneficial relationship with the investigator. Some \nconfidential informants may see their cooperation with law enforcement agencies as a type of informal “insurance policy” which could merit leniency should they be arrested for criminal acts in the future. Use of this class of source requires a high level of administrative control in addition to well-developed protocols for the handling of the source and the protection of his or her identity. Exceptional levels of skill are demanded \nof investigators who work with confidential informants, and they should receive \nspecialized training. \n \nConfidential sources  are those who provide information obtained by virtue of their lawful \nemployment. For example, a hotel employee wi th access to registration records, or a \ntravel agent with knowledge of travel plans, would usually be classified as confidential \nsources. The motivation for a confidential source’s cooperation with law enforcement may stem from a sense of public duty, a friendship with a law enforcement officer, or the sheer excitement derived from assisting the police clandestinely. Confidential sources \nare normally not paid for their assistance and they require a lower level of management by investigators. For their protection, these sources will often ask that the information \nthey provide be used discreetly, or that a formal and open request for the information \nthey have given be made by the agency if the information is to become part of judicial proceedings or a matter of public record. Special care must be taken where a country has privacy or data protection laws, and attention paid to the fact that the employment of the source will probably be at risk.  \n \nCooperating witnesses  are sources that assist law enforcement officials in a confidential \nmanner but who are expected eventually to be witnesses in public judicial proceedings. \nCooperating witnesses may be involved in the corrupt dealings under investigation or be closely associated with the activities. A cooperating witness sometimes acts as an operative of the police in an undercover investigation and may need to know aspects of \nthe investigative plan. Motivation to act as a cooperating witness can include the same \nfactors that influence a confidential informant, i.e. revenge, financial gain, and leniency in punishment or non-prosecution for prior criminal  acts. The distinguishing characteristic of \n \n 67cooperating witnesses is the fact that their identity and cooperation with law enforcement \nwill ultimately be publicly disclosed. Accordingly, these types of sources can require relocation or other special protection by law enforcement when their role becomes \npublic. \n \n \nC.  ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEDURES \n \nLaw enforcement agencies that use sources su ccessfully as an investigative technique \nusually have established internal procedures and protocols. Failure to impose a regime \nof investigative protocols can have disastrous consequences for sources and \ninvestigators alike . \n Administrative protocols usually include the following:  \na) Use of written agreements clearly defining the separate responsibilities of both a \nsource and the law enforcement agency.   \nb) Establishment of a system of code words or numerical sequences to replace source names in general investigative files to prevent disclosure of a source’s identity.   c) Information received from sources held s eparately from general investigative files. \nd) Limitation of access to source files within the investigative agency.   \ne) Routine audit of financial records associated with source operations.  f) Use of a third party in making any payments to a source. \n Hotel rooms or specialized vehicles may be used for debriefing meetings with a source \nto prevent inadvertent disclosure of a source’s association with law enforcement officials. \nAs noted, specialized reporting formats to document source information and to conceal \nthe identity of the source can also assist.  Any administrative system for the utilization of sources should include the periodic review of source files at the managerial or executive level of the investigative agency. \nThis is of the highest importance where sources are participating in criminal activities \nunder law enforcement authorization. Cooperating witnesses, for example, may be acting as operatives in an undercover investigation of a money-laundering scheme. Close monitoring and supervisory review of the activities of these sources may prevent a complex investigation failing because of misconduct on the part of the source.    \nSome law enforcement protocols include prohibitions against utilizing individuals as \nsources who occupy certain professions or positions. Prohibited professions can include lawyers, clergymen, and physicians, all of  whom normally receive information under \nlegally recognized principles of professional confidentiality. Elected or appointed public officials can often be utilized as sources, but only under special authorization from the \nhighest level of the law enforcement agency. \n The use of cooperating witnesses often necessitates prosecutorial participation early on in the investigative process in common law jurisd ictions. This is essential if the source’s \nmotivation to cooperate is the prospect of rece iving leniency for prior criminal activity. \nThe plea negotiation process can serve to further an investigation by facilitating the co-\noperation of one criminally implicated person, as a confidential witness, against others of greater culpability in a criminal organisation. Prosecutorial assistance and cooperation is \n \n 68thus essential when defining and authorizing the quid pro quo  of the source’s \ncooperation. Investigators may also have to obtain judicial approval of any resulting agreement as well as the cooperation of a source’s lawyer.  \nD.  PROTECTION OF COOPERATING WITNESSES \n \nArticle 32* \nProtection of witnesses, experts and victims \n1. Each State Party shall take appropriate measur es in accordance with its domestic legal system \nand within its means to provide effective protec tion from potential retaliation or intimidation for \nwitnesses and experts who give testimony concer ning offences established in accordance with \nthis Convention and, as appropriate, for thei r relatives and other persons close to them. \n2. The measures envisaged in paragraph 1 of this article may include, inter alia, without prejudice \nto the rights of the defendant, including the right to due process: \n(a) Establishing procedures for the physical protec tion of such persons, such as, to the extent \nnecessary and feasible, relocating them and perm itting, where appropriate, non-disclosure or \nlimitations on the disclosure of information concerning the identity and whereabouts of such \npersons; \n(b) Providing evidentiary rules to permit witnesses and experts to give testimony in a manner that \nensures the safety of such persons, such as pe rmitting testimony to be given through the use of \ncommunications technology such as video or other adequate means. \n3. States Parties shall consider entering into agreements or arrangements with other States for \nthe relocation of persons referred to in paragraph 1 of this article. \n4. The provisions of this article shall also apply to victims insofar as they are witnesses. \n5. Each State Party shall, subject to its domesti c law, enable the views and concerns of victims to \nbe presented and considered at appropriate stages of  criminal proceedings against offenders in a \nmanner not prejudicial to the rights of the defence. \n \n*UN CONVENTION AGAINST CORRUPTION  \n \nA corrupt official can use intimidation and the threat of personal injury to witnesses or their families as a means to protect a criminal gang and its members from prosecution. More violent corrupt officials may move beyond mere threats to committing aggravated \nassault or even murder to prevent witnesses from testifying against their criminal \nenterprise. Such means can subvert the entir e legally constituted judicial process. \nAccordingly, protection of witnesses is one of the most crucial of law enforcement functions.   The handling of a corrupt official’s capability to threaten, intimidate and commits acts of \nviolence against witnesses, requires both reactive and proactive measures by law \nenforcement agencies.   A reactive approach  is exemplified  by aggressive and relentless investigation of any \nthreats or acts of violence directed at victims and witnesses in criminal cases. Corrupt \nofficials must be made to recognize that law enforcement agencies will not tolerate the \nintimidation of witnesses, and that they can expect a swift and effective response from police authorities.  The proactive approach  to the protection of victims and witnesses in criminal \nprosecutions by law enforcement involves making routine witness threat assessments \nfrom early on in the investigation, and having witness assistance and protection programmes available.  The threat assessment should be conducted by investigators on \n \n 69behalf of all the witnesses or victims who are expected to give evidence against the \ncorrupt official. Highly structured groups with  known propensities for violence are usually \npose a greater risk than does a loosely organised group with a fluid leadership structure. \nHowever, a structured group may be willing to suffer the temporary loss of some of its \nmembers through prosecution whereas a small, loosely-structured  group may react \nviolently to any perceived prosecutorial threat. Investigators should clearly establish the profile of any criminal group in relation to its likely response to witnesses.  Even where there are no expectations of threats to a witness, the witness should still be \nasked whether he or she has been the subject of any approaches, and care still taken \nduring a court hearing to ensure that the witness waits in a suitably safe location. Only where it is necessary should witnesses be required to attend at court. Where their appearance will be required, vulnerable witnesses can benefit from visiting the courtroom in advance when the court is not si tting, to familiarise themselves with the \nsurroundings and the formalities. \n Except where it is required to prove a case, witnesses’ addresses should not appear on copies of their statements and on other documents submitted to the defence.  Some countries permit written statements - where the presiding judge so allows - to be \npresented to the court in lieu of a witness appearing in person, where the witness has \nbeen the subject of intimidation or has disappeared.  Throughout, special care should be taken to ensure that witnesses are treated with care and respect. Injustices should not be done to members of the public simply by virtue of \ntheir having become unwittingly caught up in a criminal trial.  \n \n 70E. CHAPTER 6; QUESTIONS FOR DISCUSSION \n \n6.1. Your spouse works in the public service and has witnessed a corrupt act by a \nsuperior. She asks you if she should report it. What do you reply? Would your \nanswer be different if your spouse was certain to suffer retribution as a result of \nreporting it? \n 6.2 Can you reasonably be expected to protect witnesses against retribution (e.g. a \njunior staff member who reports corruption by a senior staff member from being dismissed, denied promotion etc.)?  How would you try to do this? Is it realistic to \ntry to do so other than in cases where the physical safety of the witness is \ninvolved? If not, are potential witnesses discouraged from coming forward? If not, how do you know?  How effective is your country’s witness protection program (if \nit has one: If it does not, is it realistic to establish one)? \n \n6.3. You have a case of serious corruption involving an offender with a record of \ncommitting acts of violence. You find unexpectedly that you can only obtain on the conviction of the offender if you ar e prepared to disclose the name of your \ninformant.  Your informant has acted all along on the basis that his identity would not be revealed.  Will you disclose his name?  Where does your duty lie? To the \ncommunity, who trust you to protect them against serious offenders? Or to the \ninformant, who trusts you to honour y our arrangement with him? If you do \ndisclose the name, what will you be able to do to protect the informant? \n 6.4 What is the impact on the personal life and on the family of an individual who \nenters a witness protection programme? Would you, personally, be prepared to \nsubmit yourself and your family to t hese consequences of cooperating with law \nenforcement authorities? If so, in what circumstances? \n 6.5 What forms of protection are in place to protect a complainant from being \nidentified?  Is there a difference between an informant and a witness?  Are there \nset rules in place to protect informants’ identity?  Are they different from the \nprotection given to a testifying witness?  \n6.6  Are there criminal and civil laws that  protect a complainant’s physical safety? \n 6.7  To what extent do you have credible complaint systems in place?  What types of \ncomplaint systems are in place? (i.e., suggestion boxes, telephone hotlines,  \n  internet questionnaires). Can these be improved? How might you be able to get \nimprovements made? What do you think the obstacles might be?   \n6.8    To what extent are complaints investigated for credibility before a formal \ninvestigation is launched? \n \n6.9   Is public trust in the criminal justice sy stem important ? If so, why?  How would \nyou assess the current level of public trust and what could/should be done to increase it? ? \n \n6.10 Is there a feedback mechanism in place that provides complainants with \ninformation regarding progress on investigations into their complaints?  If so, what is it? Do you think complainants are generally satisfied with the position  \n \n 71 \nCHAPTER 7 \n \nWHISTLEBLOWER PROTECTION \n \n  \nA. INTRODUCTION \n \nRecent public inquiries into major disasters and scandals have shown that a workplace \nculture of silence in the face of malpractices can cost hundreds of lives, damage thousands of livelihoods, cause tens of thousands of jobs to be lost and undermine public confidence in major institutions. In some cases, victims may be compensated but \nno one held accountable for what has happened. Even anonymous “telephone hot-lines” \nmay make little impact, especially in countries emerging from totalitarian regimes, whose contemporary culture frequently regards anonymous denunciations as being abhorrent \naberrations from the past.   \nA culture of inertia, secrecy and silence breeds corruption. People are often aware of \nforms of misconduct but are either too tolerant of their work colleagues or too frightened to report them. Non-reporting persists not only because of misplaced loyalties, but principally because a person who \"blows the whis tle\" is almost certain to be victimized. \nTo overcome this, and to promote a culture of transparency and accountability, a clear and simple framework must be established that encourages \"whistleblowing\" and \nprotects \"whistleblowers\" from victimization.36  \n \n \nArticle 33* \nProtection of reporting persons \nEach State Party shall consider incorporating into its domestic legal system appropriate \nmeasures to provide protection against any unjus tified treatment for any  person who reports in \ngood faith and on reasonable grounds to the competent  authorities any fact s concerning offences \nestablished in accordance with this Convention. \n \n*UN CONVENTION AGAINST CORRUPTION  \n \n The purpose of whistleblower protection is to encourage people to come forward to \nreport crime, civil offences (including negligence and breaches of administrative law), \nmiscarriages of justice and health and environmental threats by safeguarding them against reprisal.  \n                                            \n36  For a discussion, see “Whistlebl owers: Protection of Persons Who Report Corruption”: Tool# 36 UNODC \nAnti-Corruption Toolkit, Second Edition, February 2004; http://www.unodc.org/unodc/e n/corruption_toolkit.html . See \nalso http://www.transparency.org/sourcebook/25.html   \n \n 72B.  A LAW TO PROTECT WHISTLEBLOWERS \n \nThe main purpose of whistleblower laws is to provide legal protection for those who, in good faith, report cases of maladministration, corruption and other illicit behaviour inside \ntheir organization.  \n Some whistleblower laws are only applicable to public officials while others provide a wider field of protection, including private sector organisations and companies. Experience shows that the existence of a law alone is not sufficient to instil trust in potential whistleblowers. The law must provide for a mechanism that allows the \ninstitution to deal with the content of the message and not “shoot the messenger” as is \noften the case. In other words, the disclosure must be treated objectively and, even if it proves to be false, the law must apply as long as a whistleblower acted in good faith. It must also apply irrespective of whether or not the information disclosed was confidential, and even if the whistleblower may have technically breached the law by blowing the \nwhistle. Nor should it be for the whistleblower to have to “prove” that he or she acted in \ngood faith. \n \nThe first aim of any whistleblower act is to provide the person making the disclosure with \nlegal remedies should he or she be victimized, dismissed or treated unfairly in any other \nway for having revealed the information. The best way to protect a whistleblower is to \nkeep his or her identity, and the content of the disclosure, confidential for as long as possible and perhaps for it never to be revealed at all.   \n The part of the whistleblower law that seeks to protect whistleblowers from unfair dismissal must be compatible with the labour laws of the country concerned. In \nparticular, where the \"employment-at-will\" doctrine or similar legal principles allow \nemployers to dismiss employees without reas on, the law must create exceptions from \nthat over-arching principle. At the same time, an employer also needs protection, to ensure that \"blowing the whistle\" does not become an easy way for an employee to avoid dismissal, or to avoid other form of disci plinary action. However, it is a fact of life \nthat those who do “blow the whistle”, more often than not, wind up leaving their \nemployment of their own free will. \n \nC.  IMPLEMENTATION \n \nGenerally, the law should provide for at least two levels at which whistleblowers can report their concerns.  \n \nThe first level should include entities within the organization for which the whistleblower works, such as supervisors, heads of the organ ization or internal or external oversight \nbodies created specifically to deal with maladministration within the agency where he or she works.  \n \nWhistleblowers should also be able to turn to a second level of institution if their disclosures to a first-level institution have not produced appropriate results and, in particular, if the person or institution to which the information was disclosed:  \na) Decided not to investigate. \nb) Failed to complete the investigation within a reasonable time. c) Took no action regardless of the positive results of the investigation, or \n \n 73d) Failed to report back to the whistleblower within a given time. \n Whistleblowers should also be given the option to address second level institutions \ndirectly if they: \n \na) Have reasonable cause to believe that they would be victimized if they raised the matter internally or with the prescribed first-level external body; or b) Reasonably fear a cover-up. \n \nSecond-level institutions could be an Ombudsman, an anti-corruption agency, an Auditor \nGeneral or a member of the Legislature.   \n \nExperience shows that whistleblower laws alone do not encourage people to come forward. In a survey carried out among public officials in New South Wales, Australia, \nregarding the effectiveness of the Whistleblower Act 1992, 85 per cent of the interviewees were unsure about the readiness of their employers to protect them. Some 50 per cent stated that they would refuse to make a disclosure for fear of reprisal. The Independent Commission against Corruption (ICAC) of New South Wales concluded \nthat, in order to help the Whistleblower Act work: \na) There must be a real commitment within an organization to act upon \ndisclosures and to protect those making them; and \nb)  An effective internal reporting syst em established that is widely publicized \nthroughout the organization. \n \nIn order to ensure effective implementation of whistleblower legislation, those who \nreceive disclosures must be trained in dealing with them.  Whistleblowers often invest \nmuch of their time and energy on the allegations they make. They suffer from a high level of stress. If their expectations are not managed properly, it might prove fatal for the investigation and damage trust in the investigating body. In particular, the investigation \nprocess and the expected outcome (criminal charges, disciplinary action) must be \nexplained to the whistleblowers, as well as the likelihood of producing sufficient evidence to take action, and the duration and difficulties of investigation. Whistleblowers should also be informed that the further the investigation proceeds, the more likely it will become for their identity to be revealed and for them to be subjected to various forms of reprisal. During an investigation, whistleblowers should be kept updated about progress \nmade. Any concerns about the effectiveness of their protection must be acknowledged.  \n The law will never be able to provide full protection, and whistleblowers must always be made aware of this simple fact. It is therefore essential that the investigating body makes every effort to ensure that whistleblowers will \"last the distance\" by keeping them \ninformed about the steps being taken. They should, if necessary, be given legal advice \nand counseling.  The most effective way of protecting whistleblowers is to maintain confidentiality regarding their identity and the content of their disclosures. Some country experiences, however, show that the recipients of disclosures do not pay enough attention to this. \nInformation is leaked quietly, rumours spread, and whistleblowers suffer a variety of \nreprisals. It is not enough to prohibit the leakage of information. Instead, it may be more effective to train the recipients of disclosures on how to conduct investigations while protecting the identity of the whistleblower for as long as possible. \n \n 74 \nThe provision relating to whistleblowers in the UN Convention Against Corruption is non-mandatory, but anti-corruption experts advise that such laws are essential to the \nsuccess of any national effort to combat corruption. \n \n D. CHAPTER 7; QUESTIONS FOR DISCUSSION \n \n7.1 Do the laws of your country offer any protection to “whistleblowers”? If so, how \neffective are they? If the laws do not offe r any such protection, do you think they \nshould be enacted? Would they make any real difference in practice? \n \n7.2 A whistleblower offers you on the basis of anonymity, confidential information \nwhich the whistleblower has effectively stolen from his employer. Do you accept the information? If so, what do you do with it? If not, what do you do with it? \n 7.3 Is there an agency where whistleblowers can report corruption?  \n7.4 Are cases tried in your country based on evidence from a whistleblower? Do these \npresent any special difficulties? If so, what are they? \n 7.5 Are we regulating regulators? Who regulates the other regulators?  \n7.6 If a former employee came to you and said that he had post his job  because his \nemployer suspected he would go to the police with information about corruption, what would you be able to do? \n 7.7 If an employee came to you with secretly-recorded conversations between himself \nand another individual that provides evidence of corrupt activities within a public  \norganization, what should you do?  \n7.8 Would you report it if you believed that another prosecutor or judge was involved in \ncorrupt activities?  In what circumstances would you do this? In what circumstances would you not? If you would no t, what other steps might you take to \nremedy the situation ? \n 7.9 Is there a procedure that enables a judicial official to report corrupt activities on the \npart of other officials within the judiciar y? Is it effective? If not, how might it be \nimproved? \n \n7.10 Is there a procedure that enables a law enforcement official to report corrupt \nactivities on the part of other law enforcement officials? Is it effective. If not, how might it be improved? \n 7.11 Is reporting corrupt activity seen as a civic duty within your community? If not, how \nmight the community be encouraged to accept that it should be? \n \n \n \n \n 75CHAPTER 8 \n \nFINANCIAL INVESTIGATIONS \n \n  \nArticle 58* \nFinancial intelligence unit \nStates Parties shall cooperate with one another fo r the purpose of preventing and combating the \ntransfer of proceeds of offences established in accordance with this Convention and of promoting \nways and means of recovering such proceeds and, to that end, shall consider establishing a \nfinancial intelligence unit to be responsible for receiving, analysing and disseminating to the \ncompetent authorities reports of suspicious financial transactions.37 \n \n*UN CONVENTION AGAINST CORRUPTION  \n \nIn addition to assessments of directly or indirectly owned assets and the cost of maintaining extravagant lifestyles, financial investigations can be an extremely effective \ntool for unearthing corruption. Particularly valuable in this context is any national \nrequirement that senior officials and public decision-makers regularly declare their \nassets and liabilities, and anti-money-laundering provisions that require the reporting of significant financial transactions.  In-depth investigations into the origins of property held in the name of third parties should be made only when there are reasonable grounds to suppose that third parties \nmay be holding assets on behalf of suspected officials. Ideally, national laws should \nprovide for the comprehensive registration of significant assets (such as land, company share ownership and motor-vehicles) and for the identification of their beneficial owners. Particular forms of abuse which have been targeted by the Financial Action Task Force of the OECD include “bearer bank savings books” and “bearer shares”, ownership of \nwhich passes through a simple change in possession, leaving no paper trails.  \n Investigative agencies must have a right of acce ss to official registers, to company and \nbank documentation and to credit card records.   Anonymity of ownership is the natural ally of the criminally corrupt. If the legislation of a \ncountry does not provide for transparency, financial monitoring will probably not produce \nthe meaningful results that it might do otherwise.  \n \nA.  TARGETING \n \nOnce grounds for suspicion have been established and a particular suspect identified, \nthe screening should also include persons with whom they have strong ties, such as \nfamily members and close business associates. The proceeds of corruption are commonly deposited in bank accounts held in the name of a spouse, and, less \n                                            \n37  For examples, see “The Australian Transaction Re port and Analysis Centre (AUSTRAC)” Case \nStudy# 28 and “Financial Intelligence Processing Unit, Belgium”, Case Study# 29; the “Croatian Anti-Money-\nLaundering Department” Case Study# 30; and the “Dutch office for the disclosure of unusual transactions \n(MOT), Case Study# 31;  UNODC Anti-Corrupt ion Toolkit, Second Edition, February 2004; \nhttp://www.unodc.org:80/pd f/crime/corruption/toolkit/AC_Toolkit_Edition2.pdf  \n \n 76frequently, those of children, brothers or parents. Land and shares, too, are frequently \nregistered in the names of others to the same ends.   \nWhen financial investigations are used reactively, after a suspect has been caught and \nthe crime identified, the parameters of the financial investigation will already be more narrowly defined. The finances of the suspect can be investigated to identify assets for subsequent forfeiture or simply to uncover additional evidence of the crime. Forensic accountants can unravel even the most complex and confusing financial crimes, especially where there are specific targets on which to focus their efforts.\n38 \n \nIn cases where an anti-corruption agency intends to use the financial assets and purchasing power of a suspect to uncover potential corruption and there is no particular offence to provide a starting point, the task is much more difficult. Proactive monitoring, examining possible indicators of corrupti on such “living beyond one's means\", requires \nthe clever use of available resources and careful consideration as to who will be \ninvestigated, and why. In most jurisdictions a selective allocation of resources will be necessary.  The careful selection of a target group should include the likelihood of uncovering \ncorruption. For example, if available data suggest that employees of the authority issuing \ndriving licenses have solicited bribes, it may be tempting to launch a review of financial disclosures and tax returns filed by employees of that office. Such an exercise will, however, be most likely be fruitless. The bribes paid are likely to be small and used as \"pocket money\" rather than deposited in bank accounts or used to make large purchases. A more fruitful target may well be their immediate superiors, who may be \ntaking a significant cut of the illicit earnings.  \n Investigators should focus on reviewing the financial positions of those whose public \nduties expose them to a higher level of potential bribes. It may be probable that a larger percentage of employees in a motor driver licens ing office are soliciting bribes than there \nare in a public procurement office, but there is a greater likelihood of uncovering \nindicators of corruption when reviewing the financial positions of procurement officials where pay-offs can be extremely large.  \n \nB.  INDICATORS \n \nInitial screening may be restricted to a few significant assets that are given priority over \nothers, such as homes, second houses or holiday homes, means of transport and other \nitems of significant value.   \n The instruments used to investigate disproportionate living standards include public registers, credit card accounts (including cr edit card accounts held off-shore), expensive \nparties and wedding celebrations, children’s school  fees and private foreign travel. Bank \nand company documentation may contain further information. Requiring the verification of expenses incurred by the public  officials or persons close to them can also prove to \nbe extremely effective.   \nIllicit funds are frequently hidden in foreign bank accounts registered under false names \nor in those of corporations. Illegally-acquired property can be registered in foreign \n                                            \n38  For a practical example, please refer to the Lesotho case study in the Annex. \n \n 77jurisdictions using false identities while the corrupt official enjoys the use of the property \nin his or her home country. If the jurisdiction where the assets are held has signed a mutual legal assistance treaty (discussed in Chapter 14), it may be possible to obtain \nhelp from the authorities there in identifying them.  \n \nC. CHAPTER 8; QUESTIONS FOR DISCUSSION \n \n8.1 Is there an independent body in charge of monitoring and auditing individuals \nfinancial income, assets, and taxes such as an internal revenue service? \n 8.2 Is there a separate entity which monitors or implements financial investigations \nfor public officials specifically? \n 8.3 If there is an independent investigating body for financials, do you think that this \nbody is legitimate and productive?  \n8.4 What grounds of suspicion is reasonable enough for you to start a financial \ninvestigation? \n \n8.5 What resources are necessary in order to make this unit operate effectively in \nregards to resources, equipment and the like?  \n8.6 Are there any crimes set in place for sharing financial information of individuals \nwith others?  \n8.7 How do you balance independence of such a unit with accountability of this \nunit?  \n8.8 How can this financial intelligence unit be held accountable? \n \n8.9 Are there any laws set in place which allows private individuals to bring forth \ncharges or an investigation against the government agencies if corruption is suspected? \n \n \n 78CHAPTER 9 \n \nELECTRONIC SURVEILLANCE \n \n \nA. INTRODUCTION \n \nElectronic surveillance encompasses the use of electronic means to gather information \nand intelligence. It can include covert activities, such as video recording, wiretapping or eavesdropping; or it can include the use of audio and video recorders and transmitters, secreted on, or used by, cooperating witnesses and informants.  \nCovert  surveillance, as discussed in this chapter, is undertaken where none of the \nparties whose activities are being observed is  aware that law enforcement is secretly \nlistening and/or watching.  By contrast, consensual  recordings always involve the \nknowledge and consent of at least one of the parties to a conversation or activity.  Electronic surveillance, as an investigative tool, is often the only method available to \ninvestigators that can penetrate the veil of secrecy that habitually surrounds corrupt \nactivities. The most commonly used form of electronic surveillance is consensual and can involve the assistance of collaborating witnesses, whistleblowers,  victims of \nextortion and other recipients of corrupt proposals.   \nThe lack of tolerance for covert activities on the part of a government stems from a \ndistrust of government in general. In many  countries, past abuses of governmental \nauthority arising from political interests, personal vendettas and other nefarious motives have all served to instil public distrust to the point where society is unwilling to entrust the Government with the unbridled authority to 'spy' on the activities of the citizenry. \n \nIn most democratic societies, members of the public enjoy a right to privacy from government intrusion and to the expectation that their words and actions will not be subject to interception by the police. Where one of the parties to a corrupt or criminal conspiracy decides to expose the enterprise using electronic means to secure evidence, \nhowever, society usually tolerates the invasion of an otherwise private affair. Societies \ndo not readily tolerate their government 'spy ing' on the conversations and activities of \ncitizens without the consent or knowledge of any of the parties. This gives consensual surveillance decided advantages over completely covert operations.  \n \nB.  COVERT INTERCEPTIONS AND RECORDING \n \nThe covert category of electronic surveillance includes wiretapping, eavesdropping and \nvideo surveillance operations. However, in many countries wiretaps and eavesdropping are illegal in the absence of judicial authorizat ion, and usually very strict guidelines must \nbe observed before a judge will grant a court order authorizing them. Guidelines can help assure the protection of individual rights to privacy and, at the same time, allow for \nthe use of wiretaps during investigations of serious criminal activity and for security \nintelligence.  \n \n 79Covert interceptions of the private words and activities of citizens are arguably the most \ninvasive and aggressive sort of governmen tal intrusion into individual privacy. \nNotwithstanding, it is sometimes the only method available to law enforcement officers to \ncollect sufficient evidence to prosecute crimi nal enterprises. The extreme sensitivity with \nwhich the public views such law enforcement effort demands that strict guidelines and oversight of covert operations should be firmly  in place. Covert interceptions should be \nused as a last resort, and then only after all other efforts at evidence collection have failed or are unlikely to be effective.  \n \nC.  APPLICATION FOR COURT ORDER  \n \nGovernment wiretaps and eavesdropping, if permitted at all, generally require court orders based on a detailed showing of probable cause. To obtain a court order in a common law country, a three-step process is generally involved: \n \n• a) The law enforcement officer responsible for the investigation draws up a \ndetailed affidavit showing that there is probable cause to believe that the target telephone or other communication device is being used, or will be used, to facilitate a specific, serious, indictable crime. \n• b) A lawyer for the government works with the law enforcement officer to prepare \nan application for a court order, based upon an affidavit drawn up by the officer.  \n• c) The lawyer presents the application ex parte  (i.e. without an adversary \nhearing) to a judge authorized to issue court orders for electronic surveillance. (A junior law enforcement agent should generally not be allowed to make applications for court orders directly to a judge.) \n \nRequests for court orders should generally contain the following information:  •  a) The identity of the law enforcement officer making the application and of the \nhigh-level government lawyer authorizing the application; \n•  b) The facts and circumstances of the case justifying the application, including \ndetails of the particular offence under investigation, the identity of the person allegedly committing it, the type of communications sought, and the nature and location of the communication facilities; \n•  c) Whether other investigative procedures have been tried and have failed, or \nwhy they would be likely to fail or be too dangerous to employ; \n•  d) The period of time involved in the interception; and \n•  e) The facts concerning all previous applications involving any of the same \nsuspects or locations. \n \nD. ISSUANCE OF A COURT ORDER \n \nIn order to keep intrusions into personal privacy to a minimum, before a judge can \napprove an application for electronic surve illance and issue a court order, the judge \nshould be required first to determine that:  •  a) There is probable cause for belief that an offence covered by the law is being \ncommitted, or is about to be committed; \n•  b) There is probable cause for belief that particular communications concerning \nthat  offence will be obtained through such an interception; \n \n 80•  c) Normal investigative procedures have been tried and have failed, or appear on \nreasonable grounds to be unlikely to succeed or to be too dangerous to employ; \n• d) There is probable cause for belief that the place where the communications \nare to be intercepted are being used, or are about to be used, in connection with \nthe commission of such an offence, or are leased to, listed in the name of or are commonly used by the person under suspicion. \n In addition to showing probable cause, one of the main criteria for determining whether a court order should be issued is whether nor mal investigative techniques have been, or \nare likely to be, unsuccessful. Electronic surveillance is a tool of last resort and should \nnot be used where other less intrusive methods of investigation could reasonably be employed. Normal investigative methods usually  include visual surveillance, interviewing \nsubjects, the use of informers and telephone record analysis. Such techniques, however, often have limited value. Continuous surveillance by police can create suspicion and \ntherefore be hazardous.  Surveillance alone will not disclose the contents of a personal \nmeeting or of a telephone conversation, and questioning suspects or executing search warrants can often jeopardize an investigation.  Whereas informants are useful and should be sought out by police, the information they \nprovide does not always reveal all of the players or the extent of an operation, and great \ncare must be taken to ensure that the informants are protected. Moreover, because informants are often criminals themselves, they may not be believed in court. Telephone \nrecord analysis is helpful but does not reveal the contents of conversations, nor do records always reveal the identities of parties to the conversations. As mentioned elsewhere, other methods of investigation that may be tried include undercover \noperations and “stings” (Chapter 10). Although effective in some cases, undercover \noperations are difficult and dangerous, and “sting” operations are costly and not always successful.  If a judge approves an application, a court order may be issued specifying: \n \na)  The identity (if known) of the person whose communications are to be intercepted; b)  The nature and location of the communication facilities; c) The type of communications authorised to be intercepted and the offence to which \nthey relate; \nd)    The agency authorized to perform the interception and the person authorizing the  \n       application; and \ne)    The period of time for which interception is authorized.  A court order may also require that interim status reports are filed with the issuing judge for so long as the wiretap or eavesdropping is in progress.  \nOnce covert electronic recordings commenc e, law enforcement officers should limit \ninterception of communications to those relating to the offences specified in the court order. Before the surveillance actually begi ns, a government lawyer should convene a \nmeeting with the officers who will participate in the case to ensure that recorded material conforms to the crimes alleged in the enabling affidavit. Turning off the recording \nequipment and then performing a spot check every few minutes to determine if the \nconversation has turned to the subject of the court order usually accomplishes minimization, and avoids picking up unrelated gossip. Nevertheless, special problems may arise where criminals communicate in c odes that are designed to conceal criminal \n \n 81activity in what sounds like an uninteresting or unrelated discussion. If an intercepted \ncommunication is in a code or foreign language, and someone is not simultaneously interpreting the code or foreign language, the conversation should be recorded and \nminimization deferred until an expert in that code or language is available to interpret the \ncommunication. Should a wiretap or eavesdropping effort fail to meet the minimization parameters, then the risk is that all of the evidence obtained from the wiretap might be ruled inadmissible. \n \n \nE. RECORDING \n \nAll intercepted communications should be recorded whenever possible. As a practical matter, law enforcement officers should make working copies of the original tapes. The case officer should screen conversations that tend to prove that a crime has been, is being or will be committed. A compilation of relevant conversations, together with the corroborating surveillance reports, can often provide probable cause for search warrants \nand/or arrest warrants. \n \nF. TERMINATION OF COVERT ELECTRONIC SURVEILLANCE \n \nIn order to continue an interception beyond the time limit set by the original court order, the responsible law enforcement officer, through a government lawyer, should be required to apply for an extension based upon a new application. When the period of a \ncourt order expires, the original tapes should be made available to the issuing judge and \nsealed under court supervision. The tapes should be maintained in such a fashion for a period of years.  \nG.  CONSENSUAL RECORDING OPERATIONS \n \nUnlike covert electronic surveillance operations, consensual operations involve the \ncooperation of at least one party who is trus ted by the criminal target. The cooperating \nwitness could be a person who is suffering ex tortion or being victimized in some manner, \nor may be an ostracized member of a criminal enterprise with a personal vendetta. Again, the witness may be a criminal trading information in exchange for leniency from the court. The vast majority of electronic surv eillance operations involve such witnesses.  \n \nIn corruption investigations and other so-called “victimless crimes”, the time needed to complete a corrupt transaction is not usually critical, and frequently involves the payment of cash by one party to another. That fact is important for anti-corruption investigators. In the case of a government inspector demanding a bribe from a citizen or where, \nconversely, where a citizen offers a bribe, there is often sufficient time for an honest \ncitizen or government employee to notify the appropriate authorities before any transaction takes place and so ensure that the transaction can be recorded.   The criminal seeking leniency can usually to so me extent control the timing of meetings \nwith targeted criminals. Such flexibility presents the opportunity for law enforcement \nofficials to prepare the cooperating person to respond in such a way that electronic \nsurveillance methods can be employed. \n \n 82H.

INTRODUCTION \n \nThe use of the undercover investigator or cooperating witness acting on behalf of law \nenforcement provides a path towards investigative success when addressing criminal activity where secrecy and conspiracies are the distinguishing characteristics.  Not only the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organised Crime but also \nthe new Convention Against Corruption recognises the special place of special \ninvestigative techniques. Article 50 of the Corruption Convention mandates that “each State Party shall, to the extent permitted by the basic principles of its domestic legal system and in accordance with the conditions prescribed by its domestic law, take such \nmeasures as may be necessary … to allow for the appropriate use by its competent \nauthorities of controlled delivery and … special investigative techniques, such as \nelectronic or other forms of surveillance and undercover operations .. and to allow for the admissibility in court of evidence derived therefrom.”  \nArticle 50*  \nSpecial investigative techniques  \n1. In order to combat corruption effectively, each State Party shall, to the extent permitted by the \nbasic principles of its domestic legal system and in accordance with the conditions prescribed by \nits domestic law, take such measures as may be necessary, within its means, to allow for the \nappropriate use by its competent  authorities of controlled delivery and, where it deems \nappropriate, other special invest igative techniques, such as electronic or other forms of \nsurveillance and undercover operations, within its territory, and to allow for the admissibility in \ncourt of evidence derived therefrom. \n2. For the purpose of investigating the offences covered by this Convention, States Parties are \nencouraged to conclude, when necessary, appropria te bilateral or multilateral agreements or \narrangements for using such special investigative techniques in the context of cooperation at the \ninternational level. Such agreements or arrang ements shall be concluded and implemented in full \ncompliance with the principle of sovereign equalit y of States and shall be ca rried out strictly in \naccordance with the terms of those agreements or arrangements. \n3. In the absence of an agreement or arrangement as set forth in paragraph 2 of this article, \ndecisions to use such special investigative techniques at the international level shall be made on \na case-by-case basis and may, when necessary, ta ke into consideration financial arrangements \nand understandings with respect to the exercise of  jurisdiction by the States Parties concerned. \n4. Decisions to use controlled delivery at the in ternational level may, with the consent of the \nStates Parties concerned, include methods such as intercepting and allowing the goods or funds \nto continue intact or be removed or replaced in whole or in part. \n \n*UN CONVENTION AGAINST CORRUPTION  \n \nThe undercover technique is essential in those cases where corrupt individuals conspire together in secret to achieve criminal goals. A corrupt judge, police officer, or other public official generally engages in contact only with other corrupt parties, so that there are few, if any, persons who are able to witness and expose their corrupt practices. \n \n 84Many crimes of corruption occur with little ev idence of criminal activity, and without the \ntestimony of an insider or conspirator a successful prosecution of such crimes is unlikely. In countries where the use of the undercover technique is allowed, the use of an \nundercover investigator posing as a purchaser of a judicial or political favour, coupled \nwith demonstrative evidence such as surreptitious audio and video recordings, can provide conclusive evidence of corrupt activity.  The credibility of a professional, well-trained law enforcement investigator who has personally observed, heard, or spoken with the defendant during the course of the \ncriminal activity is generally unimpeachable.  This evidence can be especially powerful \nwhen the undercover agent has played the role of a victimized businessman or target of an organised crime activity. The effect of overwhelming evidence gathered through use of the undercover technique can bring offers of cooperation and pleas of guilty from defendants, so eliminating the need for long and expensive trial processes.  \n \nB.  THE DEFINITION OF “UNDERCOVER OPERATIONS” \n \nThe word ‘undercover’ implies engaging in a secret investigation. The identity of the law enforcement agent is disguised in order to det ect, prevent or secure evidence of criminal \nactivities. Undercover operations can be classified as simple or complex. Simple \nundercover operations usually last less than six months, have a limited budget, and have \nno sensitive issues that would elevate the operations to a higher level of review within the investigating agency.   A simple undercover operation might include the undercover officer who buys drugs from a local drug seller on two or more occasions with the investigative goal of identifying and \nsuccessfully searching and seizing the drug dealer's supply, or that of the supplier. \nSome simple undercover operations require the use of a storefront rented for a brief period or the use of vehicles or vessels registered under fictitious identities. Simple undercover operations are sometimes used to gather the predicate evidence that can lead to a more complex undercover operation.  \n \nA complex undercover investigation is usually long term and more sophisticated in both the use of specialised techniques and the creativity of the investigation itself. Complex investigations can include investigations of public officials, even if the investigation is of short duration. The sensitivity of the investi gation can elevate such cases to a “complex” \nstatus. A complex undercover operation will sometimes include the operation of a \nbusiness and the utilization of business proceeds to finance the continuation of the \nundercover investigation. Any complex investigation would usually be subject to periodic review by an undercover review committee, especially if the investigation is expected to be lengthy or highly expensive. \n \n \nC.  OVERSIGHT OF THE UNDERCOVER OPERATION \n \nLaw enforcement agencies should establish guidelines or protocols for the use of undercover techniques. Operations should always be carefully reviewed prior to implementation. They should be monitored closely by the agency leadership and \nprosecutors not only to ensure that they take place within the law but also to minimise \n \n 85the risk of personal injury to undercover agents or innocent parties. Similarly, the risks to \nproperty, financial loss, and irreparable damage to third parties must be kept to an absolute minimum. The propriety of a government’s agents engaging in any kind of \ncriminal activity, even as a possible facilitator, must be kept under review. Guidelines \nshould be in place to protect privileged or confidential relationships from interference. These should also address any legal or ethical issues which otherwise might prevent the successful prosecution of offenders at the conclusion of the undercover operation. A defendant's customary argument is that the pa rticular crime with which he or she is \ncharged would not have taken place but for the government’s actions in encouraging or \nfacilitating it. This defence is not usually successful where high professional standards \nhave been observed by the investigators. On ly through the use of published guidelines \nand close monitoring of an undercover operation can the legality and ethical nature of the undercover law enforcement investigation be assured.39  \nAuthorization to use undercover techniques should only be granted to the higher levels \nof an investigative agency. An undercover review committee can be used as a screening and monitoring device to ensure that all safeguards and legal considerations are in place. This committee might include representatives from legal, financial and investigative departments within the investigative agency who are neutral in their \ninvolvement in a particular investigation but experienced in identifying the strengths and \nweaknesses of an undercover proposal. Simple undercover operations might be approved by the local investigative agency head in conjunction with the approval of a local chief prosecutor.  \n \n \nD.  PROHIBITED CONDUCT IN  UNDERCOVER OPERATIONS  \n \nTo place matters beyond doubt, certain types of conduct on the part of undercover \nagents and operatives, such as participating in acts of violence, should be expressly prohibited by law. In practice, significant complex undercover operations have been terminated to prevent an undercover agent from having to participate in acts of violence, or to forestall planned acts of violence by the subjects of the investigation. Innovative \ninvestigative planning and enforcement action, however, can often prevent acts of \nviolence from taking place, yet still allow an undercover operation to continue without serious disruption of its investigative goals. An undercover agent, who is unexpectedly placed in a situation where a threat of serious bodily harm or death to the agent or third party is imminent, should be expected to act in accordance with his or her legal duties, even if this would effectively end the undercover operation. \n \nUndercover agents or their operatives should also be prohibited from instigating or initiating any plan to commit a crime. This prohibition is closely linked to the legal prohibition found in the criminal law of many countries to the effect that persons cannot be prosecuted for a crime that has been induced by agents of the government. This \npresumption should be negated where a person charged with such an offence is shown \nto have demonstrated a predisposition to commit the offence. The fact that the government, through its agents, participated or in some manner facilitated the criminal offence should not be a bar to prosecution if evidence of predisposition on the part of the accused is present. For example, a person who is seeking a means to launder proceeds \nfrom criminal activities should not be regarded as having been “entrapped” by \n                                            \n39  The US Federal Government’s  guidelines may be seen at http://www.usdoj.gov/olp/fbiundercover.pdf .  \n \n 86government agents who operate an undercover money laundering business, and accept \nthe proceeds for transmittal to third parties.  \nHigh moral and ethical standards must be looked for in the selection of undercover \nagents. Any immoral activity by an undercover agent known to the accused may be used to undermine the agent’s credibility at trial, or even to blackmail him or her. To prevent such activity from detracting from the professionalism of the undercover agent, proper instructions on techniques to avoid compromising situations should be provided.  \n \nE.  AUTHORIZED ACTIVITI ES FOR UNDERCOVER AGENTS \n \nPrior to the implementation of an undercover operation, prosecutorial support and guidance are generally required. In addition to a prosecutor’s office agreeing to support the operation on a continuing basis, a commitment to prosecute those charged as a result of the undercover operation should be obtained in jurisdictions where the \ninvestigative and prosecutorial functions are separate. Prosecutorial assistance should \nalso include permission for an undercover agent to engage in certain activities which might otherwise be illegal. Generally, participation in minor crimes and petty offences can be authorized if circumstances require such acts in furtherance of the investigation.   \nCertain levels of criminal activity (such as giving false testimony in judicial proceedings) \nshould require authorisation at the highest level of a law enforcement agency and in serious cases might require notification to, and approval by, a higher supervising court. Any serious criminal offence which the undercover agent or operative may be required to commit while in the course of undercover activities must be closely reviewed, and wherever possible approved by prosecuting officials in advance of the act. Emergency \ncircumstances may require the undercover agent to act independently and without prior \napproval, but proper training and professional judgment can minimize the risks that this entails. \n \n \nF.  PREPARING TH E UNDERCOVER AGENT \n \nUndercover agents should be carefully selected and properly trained in the use of \nundercover techniques. In addition to being knowledgeable about the guidelines for undercover operations, the agent should be well versed in the relevant laws, especially those relating to entrapment and illegal gov ernment actions. Undercover agents should \nbe expected to be capable of operating with limited supervision and minimal assistance \nfrom fellow officers. This requires the undercover agent to be mature in judgment and \nextremely skilled in the specialized field of undercover activity. Psychological testing is \nrecommended for undercover agents to ensure they are able to cope with the stress and demands placed on them.  Poor selection of an undercover agent can lead to poor results in the particular investigation, and, ultimately, a diminution of the credibility of the law enforcement agency itself. \n \nSophisticated undercover investigative programmes include the identification of law enforcement agents who have skills or prior expe rience in the target area of a particular \ninvestigation. For example, an investigator with experience in the banking industry may be a suitable candidate for an undercover operation involving financial services. Once \nidentified as a potential undercover agent, psychological testing will identify other \n \n 87personal traits indicating both the ability to manage stress and to be assertive and self-\nreliant. The undercover agent should be as closely matched as possible to the role he or she is expected to play. Region accents, dress and cultural awareness should be taken \ninto account. Wherever possible, the creation of elaborate false histories for an agent \nshould be avoided, especially where these involve false claims of prior imprisonment. However, scenarios establishing the background of the agent as bona fide and “trustworthy” to the subjects must be contriv ed, including such items as fictitious identity \ncards, credit histories, vehicle registries  and other manifestations of normal living \nactivity. \n \nIf a cooperating witness or other non-law enforcement operative is being used in an undercover operation, proper instructions should be provided. These should be reduced to a written agreement and signed by all the interested parties. Guidelines for the handling of cooperating witness should be provided by the law enforcement agency. Any \nbusiness relationship the operative has had with the undercover operation must be \nclearly reviewed and recorded to minimize t he possibility of future claims for damages \nbeing made against the law enforcement agency. The prosecutor should meet with the operative and clearly define what is expected of the cooperating witness and the nature and extent of any assurances that he or she can be given.  \nG.  EXTRAORDINARY INVESTIGATIVE TECHNIQUES TO COMPLEMENT \nTHE UNDERCOVER INVESTIGATION  \n \nMost undercover operations utilize other unusual investigative techniques to enhance the collection of evidence. The use of body transmitters or concealed recording devices \nis a standard procedure in many undercover investigations. Where undercover businesses are operated, audio and video recording devices should be used to augment \nthe observations and activities of undercover agents.  \n \n 88I.

INTRODUCTION \n Unless a corrupt act is exposed, how do we know whether a particular official is corrupt?  \nHow can we ensure that corrupt officials are not promoted to positions where they can wreak even more harm to the public interest than they are doing already? And, in handling allegations of corruption made against police officers in particular, how do we \nensure that morale is not adversely affected while these are investigated? Or that \ncomplainants – and innocent parties – are protected when they are acting in good faith? \nAllegations are easily made, and when they ar e not based on fact they can be morally \ndamaging. Even more importantly, how can evidence be obtained quickly and cheaply \nwhen there is a belief that corrupt patterns of behaviour have developed in particular areas of public sector activity?  \nAcute difficulties arise when complainants have a history of criminal involvement \n(especially where their complaints are made against the police). This gives a complainant a low level of personal credibility, so how can reliable evidence (either of integrity or of corrupt tendencies) be produced and presented to a court if need be, in ways consistent with the constitutional rights of officers as citizens, and in ways in which \nneither the complainant nor the person complained about is unduly “threatened”?  \n The answer to each of these questions would seem to lie in “integrity testing”.  The classic examples of the use of integrity testing lie in the area of countering \ncorruption in police forces. In various parts of the developed world, police corruption \nscandals have come in cycles. Rampant corruption has been exposed; clean-up measures have been implemented; corrupt pol ice have been prosecuted or dismissed. \nBut within a few years, a bout of fresh scandals has emerged.   This, it is now realised, is because whole reform strategies have been misplaced. They \nhave been founded on the mistaken belief that simply getting rid of “rotten apples” would \nbe sufficient to contain the problem. It is now clear that it is not enough to “clean up” an \narea of corruption when problems show. Rather, systems must be developed which ensure that there will be no repetitions and no slide back into systemic corruption. It is in the essential field of follow-up and monitoring t hat integrity testing really comes into its \nown.  It has emerged as a particularly useful tool for cleaning up corrupt police forces – \nand for keeping them clean.  So it is that integrity testing is now considered to be an effective instrument that embraces both the prevention and the prosecution of corruption.   \nThe objectives of integrity testing are to: \n \na)  Determine whether or not a particular public civil servant or branch of \ngovernment is likely to engage in corrupt practices. \n \n 90b)  Increase the actual and perceived risk to corrupt officials that they may be \ndetected, thereby deterring corrupt behaviour and encouraging officials to report instances when they are offered bribes (many genuine offers of bribes will be \ntaken for being integrity tests and be reported to protect the official’s job); and to  \nc)  Identify officials, such as police officers, who are working in areas exposed to \ncorruption as being honest and trustworthy, and therefore likely to be suitable for promotion. (For this reason it is essential that any regime of integrity testing include random elements and not rest solely on suspicion; passing an integrity test should be recorded as a credit to an official’s record, and not imply that there \nhas been an allegation of corruption against the official that an integrity test has \nfailed to confirm). \n Integrity testing has been used effectively to \"test\" whether public officials of all description resist offers of bribes and refrai n from soliciting them. As such they are \nproving to be an extremely effective and co st-efficient deterrent to corruption. \n \nB.  TARGETED AND RANDOM INTEGRITY TESTING \n \nIn an integrity test a scenario is created in which, say, a public civil servant in an everyday situation is offered a modest bribe by the person conducting the test, or else is \npresented with a situation in which he or she has an opportunity to ask for one. The \nbribe offered must be modest so that the test will be seen by a court as being “fair”, and not the creation of a situation in which a bribe is offered that is so large that even the honest might be tempted to take it.  Integrity testing can also be used as a \"targeted test\" to help verify the genuineness of \nan allegation or a suspicion of corrupt behaviour. Members of the public, criminals or \nother officials may have provided information to  law enforcement authorities alleging that \na certain person or group of persons in a particular government agency are taking or demanding bribes. Quite frequently, a complainant alleges that a specific official has solicited a bribe, but without the independent evidence provided by an integrity test, a \ncase would simply rest on the word of the complainant against that of the official; not a \nsituation that prosecutors want if they can avoid it.   In countries where courts are hostile towards evidence obtained through integrity testing, the technique still has considerable value. Reliable data can be collected that can assist in gauging the extent of corrupt practices within a particular group and be used to \ndetermine whether these should be the focus of other forms of investigative methods.  \n \nC.  FAIRNESS \n In democratic societies, it is generally c onsidered to be unacceptable for a government \nto engage in activities that encourage individuals to perpetrate crimes they might not \notherwise commit. It is, however, usually quite acceptable for a government to observe \nwhether or not someone is willing to commit a crime under ordinary, everyday circumstances. For that reason, integrity testing must be carried out with the strictest discipline. Integrity testing, like other forms of intrusive technique, is an “aggressive” exercise of state power.  To avoid the criticism of abuse of power, audio or video \nrecordings of the actual event should be made to verify that the accused person was not \nacting other than of his or her own free will, and that government agents have not \n \n 91behaved unfairly or coercively. Such recordings also help to ensure that a government \nhas sufficient evidence to pursue a successful prosecution.  \nAs an additional safeguard for all concerned, witnesses should be placed in the vicinity \nof the test to corroborate what is seen and heard on recording devices. Both random and targeted tests must be as realistic as possible in order not to expose the subject of the test to a temptation greater than that to which he or she is normally exposed. In order to ensure the fairness of the test, and for it to be accepted by both those subjected to it and the general public, the methods and scenarios used should be evaluated and approved \nby competent authorities.  \n \nD.  RANDOM REPETITION \n \nExperience in police forces where integrity tests are carried out show that it is not enough to \"clean up\", once and for all, a specific area where problems have surfaced. \nRather, systems must be developed that help  to ensure that follow-up testing is \nundertaken. The most desirable situation possible includes wide-spread publication of the fact that random integrity testing of offi cials is taking place. The actual number of \ntests need not be large.  The very fact that officials know that the tests are taking place will encourage them to report approaches, as they will not know which are genuine and \nwhich are “tests”.  \n  \nE.  INTEGRITY TESTING AND CONSTITUTIONAL CONCERNS \n Although integrity tests can be extremely effective as an investigative tool as well as being an excellent deterrent, not all courts readily accept them as a valid method of \ncollecting evidence.  \n Notwithstanding, there are substantial reasons for its use. It is one of the most effective tools for identifying and eradicating corrupt practices in government services within a short period of time.  Where corruption is rampant and levels of public trust are low, it is \none of the few tools that can promise immediate results and help restore trust in public \nadministration. It cannot be stressed enough that  legal systems that provide for \"agent \nprovocateur\" scenarios should try to ensure th at they are never designed to instigate \nconduct that makes criminals out of those who might otherwise have reacted honestly. It is therefore important to ensure that the degree of temptation is not extreme and unreasonable.  \n \nMany criminal law system s exclude evidence of an agent provocateur when the \nprovocation is considered to be excessive. However, in the United States (arguably a country in which constitutional protections are invoked more frequently than elsewhere), integrity testing is widely used in the private sector, both in screening applicants for jobs \nand in the workplace, without any serious constitutional impediments being experienced. \n \n \nF.  INTEGRITY TESTING IN NEW YO RK CITY – THEORY PUT IN TO  \n PRACTICE \n \nSince 1994, the New York City Police Department (NYPD) has been practising a very \n \n 92intensive programme of integrity testing.  Simply stated, this means that the Internal \nAffairs Bureau creates scenarios based upon known acts of police corruption, such as the theft of drugs and/or cash from a street level drug dealer, to test the integrity of \nNYPD officers. The tests are carefully monitored and recorded using audio and video \nelectronic surveillance and numerous “witnesses” are placed at or near the scene.  The NYPD strives to make the scenarios as realistic as possible and they are based on extensive intelligence collection and analysis. All officers are aware that such a programme exists and that their own conduct may be subjected, from time to time, to \nsuch tests (although they are not told about the frequency of such tests which has \nproduced a sense that they are far more frequent than they are in practice).  Integrity tests are administered on both a targeted and a random basis. That is, certain tests are directed or “targeted” at specific officers who are suspected of having \ncommitted corrupt acts, usually based upon one or more allegations from members of \nthe public, criminal informants or even other officers,  \n However, in addition a proportion of the tests are directed against officers selected at random, based upon the knowledge that they are engaged in work which is susceptible \nto certain acts of theft or corruption. All the tests are carefully planned to avoid \nentrapment, and no officer is “enticed” into committing an act of corruption. The scenario merely creates realistic circumstances in which an officer might choose to engage in a corrupt act.   More than 1,500 integrity tests are administered each year among a force of 40,000 \nofficers. The data produced by these tests provides reliable, empirical evidence of the \nrate of corruption among NYPD officers. The results have been both useful and instructive.  The rate of failure (i.e., when the subject engages in a corrupt act) in the “targeted” tests \nis significant. About 20 per cent of the officers tested on this basis fail the test, \nwhereupon they are prosecuted and removed from the force. This would seem to validate both the reliability of carefully analysed public complaints and allegations of police corruption, and the efficiency of the specific integrity tests employed.   In contrast with the comparatively high number who fail the “targeted” test, only about \none per cent of the officers who are subjected to “random” tests fail. This would seem to \nsupport the long held view of senior NYPD management that the vast majority of its officers are not corrupt.  In addition to providing valuable empirical evidence about the rate of corruption among \npolice officers, integrity testing has produced very useful lessons about the strengths \nand weaknesses of the supervision and control of police officers in the field. Such lessons are used to develop better training and more effective policies to ensure that police services are provided effectively and honestly.  The NYPD has also seen a dramatic rise in the number of reports by police officers \nthemselves of offers of bribes since the integrity-testing programme was initiated. Some \nof the rise is undoubtedly attributable to the fact that NYPD police officers are concerned that their actions are now the subject to monitoring, and that even a single failure to report a corrupt offer could subject them to disciplinary action.  \n \n 93 \nBuilding on the New York success, the UK London Metropolitan Police has initiated a similar programme of integrity testing, administered by specialist internal Anti-Corruption \nUnits, and early reports indicate that they are obtaining some of the same benefits. \n \nIn tandem with integrity testing there should be independent Police Complaints Boards – \nso that the police are not left in the position of investigating complaints against themselves – and with civil society representation to assure the public that the procedures adopted are thorough and appropriate  \n  \nG. INVESTIGATIVE TECHNIQUES: WIDER USES OF INTEGRITY TESTING \n \nThe concept need not be confined to police activities. In some countries hidden \ntelevision cameras have been used in the ordinary process  of criminal investigations to monitor the illicit activities being conducted in the chambers \n(or private offices) of judges, capturing corrupt transactions between judges and \nmembers of the legal profession. The “integrity testing” technique might therefore be developed in the context of judicial integrity testing. It would also have potential for use in other areas where the public sector is engaged in direct transactions with members of the public, particularly in customs. \n \nIt would be interesting, too, to see the effect of this same approach in the area of international government procurement contracts. One could arrive at a situation where major international corporations bidding on government contracts in a developing country had to contend with an integrity testing programme, knowing that the payment of any bribe (or even the failure to report the solicitation of a bribe) would subject them to \ninstant exposure as a corrupt company, and to public blacklisting. It would seem to be a \nsimple matter to use integrity testing to cull out junior staff who are taking a large number of small bribes. Yet junior officials do not lie at the heart of the corruption problem. It will be more difficult to adapt the methodology to counter those senior officials who are involved in a small number of highly-lucrative transactions. \n \nThe possibilities the technique presents for the developing world have yet to be thoroughly explored. However, on face value there would seem to be considerable merit in establishing a system that is known to all officials (be they police, customs or elsewhere in the system), at the very leas t, as a means for tackling and reducing levels \nof petty corruption. \n \n 94H. CHAPTER 11; QUESTIONS FOR DISCUSSION \n \n 11.1 Is “integrity testing” carried out in y our country? If not, what do you think would be \nthe reaction of the courts if your country were to introduce “integrity testing”? Are \nactions by agents provocateurs prohibited by  the laws of your country? If not, is \nthere any reason why “integrity testing” should be treated differently? \n 11.2 What are the “do’s” and “don’ts” in conducting “integrity tests”?  \n11.3 Are there laws protecting persons against entrapment if integrity testing is \nabused?  \n11.4 Are there standardized procedures which law enforcement or investigators must \nfollow in order to keep the integrity testing within the boundaries permitted by any  \nentrapment laws?  \n \n11.5 Does the court system admit video or audio recordings as evidence in a criminal \ncase? In civil cases? If not, what are the public policy reasons for excluding them? \n \n11.6 How often is integrity testing used within your country.  Do you regard this as \nexcessive? Or as insufficient?  \n11.7 To what level of reliability do you feel you can rely on the results of an integrity \ntest in prosecuting a case? Is corroborative evidence required? \n \n11.8 How much information must be received on an individual before suspicion is \nraised to the level to justify integrity testing? What are the advantages of conducting random integrity tests?  \n11,9 To what extent do you believe an int egrity testing system should be based on its \nresponding to a pattern of complaints of similar activity?  \n11.10 If so, how do you establish the pattern to justify integrity testing?  \n \n11.11 What other measures, if any, do you believe are necessary to be used in combination with  \nan  integrity test?  What circumstances do you believe should exist before integrity testing is \nused? \n  \n \n 95CHAPTER 12 \n \nINTERNATIONAL JUDICIAL COOPERATION \n \n  \nA. INTRODUCTION \n It is now widely accepted that measures to  address corruption must go beyond domestic \ncriminal justice systems. In a modern world, “n o country is an island” in the sense that it \ncan quarantine itself from the impact of events elsewhere. Corruption is no exception, and its links to international organised crime, drug trafficking and terrorism is plainly \nrecognised.   \n \nThe growth in understanding of both the scope and seriousness of the problem of corruption is reflected in the evolution of international action against it. This has progressed from general consideration and declarative statements\n40; to the formulation \nof practical advice 41; to the development of binding legal obligations; and now to the \nemergence of numerous cases in which one country has sought the assistance of \nanother, not only in the investigation and prosecution of corruption cases but also in the pursuit of their illicit proceeds.    This understanding has also progressed from relatively narrowly-focused measures directed at specific crimes (such as briber y) to more broadly-focused measures against \nit; from regional instruments developed by groups of relatively like-minded countries \n(such as the Organisation of American States,\n42 the African Union, 43 the OECD, 44 \nand the Council of Europe 45), to the globally-based United Nations Convention Against \nCorruption .46  Actions on specific issues with in specific regions have become more \ngeneral in order to deal with the problem more effectively. \n   \n                                            \n40 See, for example A/RES/51/59 and 51/191,  annexes, and the discussion held at the 9th UN Congress on \nthe Prevention of Crime and Treat ment of Offenders, held in Ca iro from 29 April – 8 may 1995 \n(A/CONF.169/16/Rev.1, paragraphs 245-261. \n41 See, for example, the United Nations Manual Practical Measures against Corruption , ECOSOC \nRes.1990/23, annex, recommendation #8 and International Review of Criminal Policy, Special Issue, Nos. \n41 and 42, New York 1993.

THE UNITED NATIONS CONVENTION AGAINST CORRUPTION OF 03 \n \nConcern about corruption as an international problem has increased greatly in recent \nyears. The most dramatic development has been the signing in December 2003 of the \nUnited Nations Convention Against Corruption in Mérida, Mexico. The Convention will enter into force when it has been ratified by 30 countries.  The Convention represents a major step forward in the global fight against corruption, and in particular in the efforts of UN Member States to develop a common approach to \nboth domestic efforts and international cooperation. The Convention can be seen as the \nproduct of a series of both procedural and substantive developments.   In formulating the terms of reference for the negotiation of the Convention, the relevant Intergovernmental Open-ended Expert Group concluded that the new convention should \nbe “comprehensive” (in the sense that it should deal with as many different forms of \ncorruption as possible), and “multidisciplinary” (in the sense that it should contain the \nbroadest possible range of measures for countering corruption).\n47  The Group began \nthe development of a broad inventory of spec ific forms of corruption, including areas \nsuch as trading in official influence, general abuses of power, and various acts of corruption within the private sector which had not been dealt with in many of the earlier \ninternational instruments.\n48 \n \nBuilding on the broad range of measures included in the Convention Against Transnational Organized Crime, the Expert Group called for the creation of specific criminal offences and for the provision of fresh investigative and prosecutorial powers. \nAll of these basic elements appear in some form in the final Convention, with criminal \noffences specifically tailored to corruption.\n49  To go beyond the scope of the Convention \nAgainst Transnational Organized Crime, a series of specific preventive anti-corruption \nmeasures were added, both to promote transparency and high standards of conduct (particularly in the public service) and to provide approaches for preventing corruption \nfrom taking place\n.50  A further significant development was the inclusion of a specific \nChapter dealing with the recovery of assets, a major concern for countries pursuing the \nassets hidden abroad by former leaders and senior officials found to have engaged in corruption.   \n \n                                            \n47 Report of the Meeting of the In tergovernmental Open-ended Expert Gr oup, A/AC.260/2, particularly at \nparagraph 27, and A/RES/56/260, paragraph 2 calling for a “broad and effective” instrument, and paragraph \n3, calling for a “comprehensive and multidiscipli nary” approach in developing the instrument. \n48 A/AC.260/2, paragraph 27 \n49 For a complete review of the hist ory of the negotiations and consider ation of specific issues, see the \nofficial records of the Ad Hoc Committee,  available from the UNODC web-site at: \nhttp://www.unodc.org/unodc/crime_cicp_convention_corrupt ion_docs.html.  In particular see the successive \ntexts of the revised draft Convent ion, A/AC.261/3 and A/ AC.261/3/Rev.1 – Rev.5 and the footnotes to \nspecific provisions. \n50 For example, Article 8 deal with codes of conduct and other measures specific ally directed at public \nservants and public service situations, whereas Arti cle 13 deals with the more general participation of \nsociety in preventing corruption. \n \n 97The text of the new Convention covers the following major areas: \n \nChapter I General Provisions . The opening Articles include a statement of purpose \n(Article 1) which covers both the promotion of integrity and accountability within each \ncountry and the support of international cooperation and technical assistance between States Parties.  They also include definitions of critical terms used in the instrument. Some of these are similar to those used in other instruments (in particular the Convention Against Transnational Organized Crim e), but those defining “public official”, \n“foreign public official”, and “ official of a public international organization” are new. \nThese definitions are important for determining the scope of application of the \nConvention in these areas. \n \nChapter II Preventative measures . The Convention contains an inventory of preventive \nmeasures which go far beyond those of prev ious instruments in both scope and detail, \nreflecting the importance of prevention and the wide range of specific measures which \nhave been identified by experts in recent years. Particular requirements include: \n1 the establishment of specialized procedures and bodies to develop   domestic prevention measures;  2 money-laundering and other provisions si milar to those in other anti-crime \ninstruments;  \n3 preventive measures specific to co rruption, such as general requirements \ndealing with transparency in public administration; \n4 specific measures dealing with particu larly critical areas such as public \nsector staffing, public procurement, and judicial institutions; and  \n5 the disclosure of assets, incomes and other important personal \ninformation by public officials.  \n Specific Articles dealing with the prevention of private-sector corruption and the participation of society in anti-corruption efforts are also included. \n \nChapter III Criminalization and law enforcement . The development of the Convention \nreflects the recognition that although efforts to control corruption must go beyond the criminal law, criminal justice measures are still a major element in the package.  The Convention calls on States Parties to establish or maintain a series of specific criminal offences including not only long-established crimes such as various forms of bribery and embezzlement, but also conduct which may not yet be criminalised in many states, such \nas trading in official influence and other abuses of official functions.  The manner in \nwhich corruption has manifested itself in different countries and the apparent “novelty ” of \nsome of the offences pose significant legislative and constitutional challenges.  To accommodate these factors some of the Convention’s requirements are either optional on the part of States Parties (“…shall consider adopting…”) or subject to domestic \nconstitutional or other fundamental requirements (“…subject to its constitution and the \nfundamental principles of its legal system…”).  An example of this is the offence of illicit enrichment, in which the onus of proving that a significant increase in the assets of a public official was not illicit is placed on the official concerned.  This has been shown to be a powerful anti-corruption instrument in the hands of many states, but is a matter of controversy in others.  \n \nOther criminal justice measures are similar to those of the 1988 United Nations Convention Against the Illicit Traffic in Na rcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances and \nthe 2000 Convention Against Transnational Organized Crime.  These include offences \n \n 98relating to obstruction of justice and money laundering, jurisdiction, the seizing, freezing \nand confiscation of proceeds, protection of witnesses and other matters relating to investigations and prosecutions.  The subject of the sharing or return of corruption \nproceeds is also dealt with, but in a separate part of the Convention. \n \nChapter IV International cooperation . The Convention deals with the same basic areas \nof cooperation in the course of investigations and other law-enforcement activities as previous instruments, including the extraditi on of offenders, mutual legal assistance and \nless-formal forms of cooperation. A key issue goes beyond previous treaties.  Many \ndelegations were willing to accept that some countries, for constitutional or other \njurisprudential reasons, could not criminalise specific types of corruption, but wanted to ensure that those countries would still be obliged to cooperate with others that had done so.  The result was a compromise, in which dual criminality requirements are deemed fulfilled if the “conduct underlying” the offence for which assistance is sought constitutes \na criminal offence (however described) in both of the countries involved, even if the \nwording of the offences was not identical. In addition to cooperating in criminal cases, States Parties are called upon to consider assisting one another in civil or administrative proceedings as well. \n \nChapter V Asset recovery.  As noted above, the development of a legal basis for \ncooperation in the tracing, seizing, freezing and return of assets derived from, or associated in some way with, corruption was of major concern to developing countries. A number of these countries were then actively seeking the return of assets alleged to \nhave been corruptly obtained by former senior  officials.\n51 To assist delegations, a \ntechnical workshop featuring expert presentations on asset recovery was held during the \nnegotiations,  and the subject matter was discussed extensively.  52 \n \nGenerally, countries seeking assets sought to establish presumptions that would \nestablish their right to ownership of the assets and give priority to their return over other means of disposal.  Countries from which return was likely to be sought, on the other hand, had concerns about the incorporation of language that might compromise basic human rights and procedural protections associated with criminal liability.  From a \npractical standpoint, there was also an effort to make the process of asset recovery as \nstraightforward as possible, provided basic safeguards were not compromised. \n \nThe provisions of the Convention dealing with asset recovery begin with the statement that the return of assets is a “fundamental principle” of the Convention.  The substantive provisions then set out a series of mechanisms, including both civil and criminal recovery \nprocedures, whereby assets can be traced, frozen, seized, forfeited and returned. In \ncases of embezzled public funds, the funds are returnable directly to the requesting State Party.  Funds derived from other corruption offences are returnable directly to the requesting State Party where it has established its ownership. Where this has not been achieved, consideration must be given to returning the funds either to the requesting \nState or to a prior legitimate owner. Alternatively, they can be used to compensate the \nvictims of the crime\n.53 \n                                            \n51 This was the subject of extensive research  and discu ssion for some time prior to the mandate of the Ad \nHoc Committee.  See, for example, reports of the Se cretary General to the General Assembly at its 55th \nsession (A/55/405, see also A/RES/55/188); 56th session (A/56/403) and 57th session (A/57/158). \n52 See A/AC.261/6/Add.1 an d A/AC.261/7, Annex I. \n53 Article 57, paragraph 3, subparagraphs (a)-(c). \n \n 99 \nChapter VI Technical assistance and information exchange . The provisions for technical \nassistance (including research, analysis and training) are similar to those developed with \nrespect to transnational organised crime. However, the broader and more extensive \nnature of corruption is expected to generate significant differences when these provisions are implemented.  Cases involvi ng transnationality are likely to overlap with \nthe Convention Against Transnational Organised Crime of 2000. \n \nChapter VII Mechanisms for implementation . The concluding provisions of the new \nConvention establish a Conference of States Parties to assist countries in carrying out \nthe various obligations it contains, reviewing implementations and developing recommendations to improve the Conventi on and its implementation.  The resolution \nwhereby the General Assembly adopted the Convention declares it to be open for signature and ratification, and Article 68 provides that it comes into  force on the ninetieth \nday after the date of deposit of the thirtieth instrument of ratification acceptance, \napproval or accession. The adopting resolution also calls upon the Secretary General to support and assist Member States in their efforts to ratify and fully implement the Convention, and urges Member States to prov ide the necessary resources to carry out \nthis work.\n \n \nC.  THE UNITED NATIONS CONVEN TION AGAINST TRANSNATIONAL \nORGANIZED CRIME OF 2000 \n \nThe United Nations Convention Against Transnational Organized Crime , adopted by the \nUN Millennium General Assembly in November 2000, is focused on the activities of organized criminal groups. It does, however, recognize that, in many cases, corruption is both an instrument and an effect of organized criminal activity, and that a significant \nportion of the corruption associated with organi zed crime is sufficiently transnational in \nnature to warrant the development of several provisions in the Convention. The Convention is a binding international legal instrument, although the degree to which each individual provision is binding depends on the particular wording  used. It is presently open for signature and ratification, and may achieve the necessary number of \nratifications, to come into force during 2002 or 2003. \n The Convention establishes four specific crim es to combat activities commonly used in \nsupport of transnational organized crime activi ties: participation in organised criminal \ngroups, money-laundering, corruption and obstruction of justice. States Parties are required to criminalize those activities, as well as to adopt legislation and administrative \nsystems to provide for extradition, mutual legal assistance, investigative cooperation, \npreventive and other measures, as necessary , to bring existing powers and provisions \nup to the standards set by the Convention. In addition to establishing a corruption offence (Article 8), the instrument also requires the adoption of measures to prevent and combat corruption (Article 9). \n \nThe criminalization requirements include central provisions that are binding on States Parties, and supplementary provisions that are discretionary. The mandatory corruption offences capture both active and passive corruption: \"…the promise, offering or giving…\" as well as \"…the solicitation or acceptance…\" of any \"undue advantage\". \n \nIn both offences, there must be:  \n(i)  a \"public official\" and  \n \n 100(ii)  the advantage conferred must be linked in some way to his or her acting \ncorruptly, or refraining from acting, in the course of official duties, and  \n(iii)  the advantage corruptly conferred may be conferred directly or indirectly.  \n \nStates Parties are also required to criminalize participation as an accomplice in such offences.   As well as the mandatory offences, States Parties are also required to consider criminalizing the same conduct where the person promising, offering or giving the benefit \nis in one country and the public official who re quests or accepts it is in another. States \nParties are also required to consider criminalizing other forms of corruption. In cases where the public official involved was working in a criminal justice system and the act of corruption was directed at distorting legal proceedings, the Convention offence relating to the obstruction of justice would also usually apply. \n \nIn addition to criminalization requirements, the Convention also requires the adoption of \nadditional measures against corruption. The text calls for \"…legislative, administrative or \nother effective measures to promote integrity and to prevent, detect and punish the corruption of public officials”. It does not specify details of the measures to be adopted, \nbut requires steps to ensure that officials take effective action, including granting \nappropriate authorities sufficient independence to protect them against inappropriate influences.  Other Convention provisions may also prove useful in specific corruption cases, notably the Articles establishing the money laundering offence and providing for the tracing, \nseizure and forfeiture of the proceeds of crime. The Convention requires States Parties \nto adopt, to the greatest extent possible within  their domestic legal systems, provisions \nto enable the confiscation of any proceeds derived from offences under the Convention and any other property used in, or destined for use in, an offence under the Convention. Courts or other competent authorities must hav e powers to order disclosure or seizure of \nbank, financial or commercial records to assist in asset tracing. Bank secrecy cannot be \nraised as an obstacle to either the tracing of the proceeds of crime or the provision of mutual legal assistance in general. Once proceeds or other property have been confiscated, they can be disposed of in accordance with the domestic laws of the confiscating State, but that State is required to give \"…priority consideration…\" to returning them to a requesting State Party in order to facilitate the compensation of \nvictims or the return of property to its legitimate owner. \n The application of the Convention of 2000 is generally limited to cases that involve an \"organized criminal group\" or events that are \"transnational in nature\". The requirements of transnationality and organized criminal group involvement have to be met if the \nvarious international cooperation requirements are to be invoked in corruption cases. \nWhere these requirements are met, a wide range of assistance and cooperation provisions apply as between States Parties to the Convention to assist in investigations \nand, ultimately, to help secure the extradition or prosecution of offenders. \n \n \n 101D.  OECD CONVENTION ON CO MBATING BRIBERY OF FOREIGN \nPUBLIC OFFICIALS IN INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS TRANSACTIONS OF 1997 \n \nThe OECD concluded the Convention on Combating Bribery of Foreign Public Officials in International Business Transactions in November 1997. It came into force on 15 \nFebruary 1999. As of early 2004, some thirty-five countries had ratified the Convention. \nGiven the role of the private sector in international corruption and its impact on development in the developing world, the Conv ention is of considerable significance. \n As its name implies, the OECD Convention is relatively narrow in its scope. The sole \nfocus is to use domestic law in exporting countries to criminalize the bribery of foreign \npublic officials. It applies both to active and passive bribery but does not apply to forms of corruption other than bribery, i.e. to bribery that is purely domestic or to bribery in which the direct, indirect or intended recipient of the benefit is not a public official. Nor does it apply to illicit political donations (arguably the largest loophole in the Convention’s framework). Excluded, too, are cases where a bribe was paid for purposes \nunrelated to the conduct of international business and the gaining or retaining of some \nundue advantage in such business.  The obligation to criminalize includes any ca se where the offender offers, promises or \ngives \"…any undue pecuniary or other advantage …to a foreign public official…\" in order \nto induce the recipient or another person to act or refrain from acting in relation to a \npublic duty, if the purpose was to obtain or retain some business or improper advantage in the conduct of international business. States Parties are required to ensure that incitement, aiding and abetting or authorizing bribery is also criminalized, which means that lawyers and accountants who knowingly pr ovide professional services in support of \nsuch bribery are also liable to prosecution. The offences in the OECD Convention must \nalso apply to corporations and other legal persons, in addition to individuals. Attempts at \nbribery and conspiracies to bribe, which pose a problem for some legal systems, must be criminalized if the equivalent conduct of bribing a domestic public official is criminalized. Prosecutorial discretion is rec ognized, but the Convention requires that it \nshould be exercised on the basis of professional rather than political criteria. \n \nPunishments must be \"effective, proportionate and dissuasive\", and of sufficient seriousness to trigger the application of domestic laws governing mutual legal assistance and extradition. Any proceeds, or property of equivalent value, must be either the subject of powers of seizure and forfeiture or the imposition of equivalent monetary \nsanctions. Bribing foreign public officials must also trigger national money-laundering \nlaws to the same extent as the equivalent bribery of a domestic official. In addition to criminal, civil and administrative penalties to  ensure compliance, the instrument also \nrequires measures to be taken so as to deter and detect bribery in the form of accounting practices in order to prevent domestic companies from concealing bribes \npaid to foreign officials. \n \nSince the OECD Convention came into force, the OECD Working Group on Bribery in International Business Transactions has adopted a rigorous process of assessing the status of implementation and compliance with its terms. Not only do countries assess their own progress, they also assess that of other States Parties. Since 1999, peer \n \n 102review has taken place in over half of the 34 States Parties. For each country the \nWorking Group conducted an evaluation that was then made available to the public. \n \nE.  CRIMINAL LAW CONVENTION ON CORRUPTION OF 1998 \n \nThe Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe adopted the text of the Criminal \nLaw Convention on Corruption in November 1998. In addition to European countries, it is also open for signature and ratification by other, non-Member States that participated in its negotiation. Other States can also join by accession once the instrument is in force, \nprovided that certain preconditions are met, including the consent of all the contracting \nStates that sit in the Committee of Ministers of the Council.  \n The required 14 ratifications for the Criminal Law Convention on Corruption to enter into force was reached on 1 July 2002. As of July, 2004, some thirty signatures had been followed by ratifications/accessions and sixteen States had signed but had not yet ratified.54   \n \nThe Convention applies to a broad range of occupations and circumstances but is relatively narrow in the scope of the actions or conduct that States Parties are required to criminalize. It contains provisions crimina lizing a list of specific  forms of corruption; \nand it extends to active and passive forms of corruption as well as to both private and \npublic sector cases.  \n The OECD Convention also deals with a range of transnational cases. Bribery of foreign public officials and members of foreign public assemblies is expressly included; offences established pursuant to the private sector criminalization provisions would generally \napply in transnational cases in any State Party where a portion of the offence had taken \nplace sufficient to trigger domestic jurisdictional  rules. Most of the offences established \nare limited to “bribery”, which the instrument does not define. Trading in influence and laundering the proceeds of corruption must also be criminalized, but the instrument does not deal with such forms of corruption as extortion, embezzlement, nepotism or insider trading.  As with other international instrument s, it does not seek to define or criminalize \n“corruption” in general terms. \n The Convention requires States Parties to ensure that they have specialized \"persons or entities\" dedicated to the fight against corruption. These must be given sufficient independence, training and resources to enable them to operate effectively. It also provides for the protection of informants and witnesses who cooperate with \ninvestigators, the extradition of offenders, mutual legal assistance and other forms of \ncooperation. The tracing, seizing and freezing of property used in corruption, and the proceeds of corruption, are also provided for, but the text is framed in terms of international cooperation and does not deal with the return or other disposal of recovered proceeds. Mutual legal assistance may be refused if acceding to a request \nwould undermine the fundamental interests, national sovereignty, national security or \n'ordre public' (public interest) of the requested Party. Most importantly, it may not be refused on the grounds of infringing bank secrecy. \n \n \n                                            \n54  Source, Council of Europe Treaty Office: http://conventions.coe.int  \n \n 103F.  CIVIL LAW CONVENT ION ON CORRUPTION OF 1999 \n \nThe Council of Europe’s Civil Law Convention on Corruption of 1999 was the first attempt to define common international rules for civil litigation in corruption cases. The \nConvention requires States Parties to \"cooperate effectively\" in civil cases, to take steps \nto protect those who report corruption, and to ensure the validity of private sector accounts and audits.   Whereas the Criminal Law Convention seeks to control corruption by ensuring that offences and punishments are in place, the Civil Law Convention requires States Parties \nto ensure that those affected by corruption can sue the perpetrators under civil law, \neffectively drawing the victims of corruption into the anti-corruption strategy of the Council.  Generally, this has the advantage of making co rruption controls partly self-enforcing by \nempowering victims to take action on their own initiative. On the other hand it entails \nsome loss of control on the part of Government agencies. Some potential litigants may effectively be excluded by their lack of resources, but in some jurisdictions such a right can give rise to class actions, brought on behalf of a large number of victims. Corporate civil litigants, on the other hand, do have the financial means to bring a civil action. \nHowever, they are likely to settle proceedings purely on business or economic grounds, \nand this may not accord with the overall anti-corruption strategy of the Government.   Some argue that creating a civil action may also give rise to conflicting or parallel civil and criminal proceedings, and a need for rules to resolve such problems. This is to overlook the fact that many criminal offences  (e.g. of assault) carry with them rights to \nsue for compensation in the civil courts. There is much to be said for the civil law \ncountries’ procedure of combining both criminal and civil proceedings into the one single court action.   As with the Criminal Law Convention, the Ci vil Law Convention is drafted as a binding \nlegal instrument. Civil law provisions must  be enacted that ensure that anyone who has \nsuffered damage resulting from corruption can recover \"…material damage, loss of profits and non-pecuniary loss.\" Damages can be recovered against anyone who has committed a corrupt act, authorized someone else to do so, or failed to take reasonable steps to prevent the act, (including the state itself), provided that a causal link between the act and the damages claimed can be proved . This provision sits well in a European \ncontext. However, for developing countries there would be the possibility that civil claims \ncould be mounted against the state on the grounds of public officials being involved in acts of corruption that have caused losses to third parties, e.g. in the tender processes of an exercise in public procurement. This c ould mean that the public interest could be \ndamaged twice over; first, as victims of the co rrupt actors, and then again as having to \npay damages as compensation for what they have done. These would be losses a \ndeveloped country might be expected to absorb, but could be catastrophic for a very poor one.  Courts are also given the power to declare contractual obligations to be null and void \nwhere the consent of any party to the contract has been \"undermined\" by corruption.  \n \n \n 104In the scope of the types of corruption to which it applies, the Civil Law Convention is \nnarrower than its criminal law counterpart as it extends only to bribery and similar acts. It does, however, apply to such acts in both the private and the public sector.  \n \nThe Civil Law Convention on Corruption reached the 14 ratifications required for it to enter into force on 1 November 2003. As of July, 2004, the total number of ratifications/accessions stood at twenty-one, and the total number of signatures not yet followed by ratification was seventeen.55 \n \nG.  CONVENTION ON THE PROTEC TION OF THE EF’S FINANCIAL \nINTERESTS AND PROTOCOLS THERETO OF 95 \n \nThe Convention (1995) and its two protocols (1996 and 1997) represent an early attempt on the part of the European Union (EU) to address forms of malfeasance that are harmful to the financial interests of the Union itself. They are legally binding on Member States and address corruption and other financial or economic crimes, as well as related conduct, but only insofar as the conduct involved affects the interests of the EU itself. \nThe Convention deals with a list of conduct designated as \"fraud affecting the European \nCommunities' financial interests\".  The first protocol deals with active and passive corruption, and the second with money- laundering and the confiscation of the proceeds of fraud and corruption. The forms of \nactive and passive corruption dealt with in the first protocol generally consist of bribery \nand similar conduct, in which some promise, benefit or advantage is solicited, offered or exchanged in return for undue influence on the exercise of a public duty.  The forms of fraud set out in the Convention of 1995 itself cover other areas of corruption, such as the submission of false information to a public authority to induce it \nto pay funds or transfer property that it w ould not otherwise have done. The first protocol \ndistinguishes between the criminal conduct of officials, who can commit \"passive corruption\" by requesting or receiving bribes  or similar considerations, and others, who \ncommit \"active corruption\" by promising or  giving such considerations for improper \npurposes. \n \nThe other instruments require States Parties to incorporate (\"transpose\") the principles set out into their national criminal law, which would generally result in offences being applicable to everyone who engages in the prohibited conduct. Generally, the question of the liability of legal persons, such as corporations, would be covered by the same \nprinciple. Article 3 of the Convention further calls for the heads of businesses or those \nexercising control within a business to be held criminally liable in cases where a business commits a fraud offence. \n \nH.  THE CONVENTION ON THE FIGHT AGAINST CORRUPTION \nINVOLVING EUROPEAN COMMUNITY OFFICIALS OR OFFICIALS OF \nMEMBER STATES OF 1997 \n \nThe Convention incorporates essentially the same terms as the 1995 Convention on the \nProtection of Financial Interests ( see above ), but the coverage has been broadened to \n                                            \n55  Source, Council of Europe Treaty Office: http://conventions.coe.int   \n \n 105include conduct on the part of officials of the European Community and its Member \nStates. The conduct to which it applies is essentially bribery and similar offences that States Parties are required to criminalize. It does not deal with fraud, money-laundering \nor other corruption-related offences. \n \nI.  THE INTER-AMERICAN CONVENT ION AGAINST CORRUPTION OF 66 \n \nThe principal focus of the anti-corruption strategy of the Organisation of American States (OAS) has been the Inter-American Convention against Corruption of 1996. The Inter-American Convention is drafted as a binding legal instrument, although some specific \nprovisions contain language that limits or provides some element of discretion with \nrespect to its application. Perhaps its most imaginative advance in the fight against corruption was to provide that the fact that an act of corruption involved political motives or purposes did not necessarily render those offences \"political offences\". This closed off an escape route for fugitive officials who might otherwise claim exemption from legal \nassistance and extradition procedures.  \n Generally, the obligations to criminalize acts of corruption are mandatory. States Parties need only “consider” taking other steps, such as certain preventive measures. The instrument has been in force since 6 March 1997, having been ratified by 20 OAS \ncountries. Countries that are not OAS members may also become Parties by acceding \nto it.  It is open to States Parties to apply the Convention to other forms of corruption if other countries agree. The instrument also applies to attempted offences and to various categories of participant, such as conspirators and those who instigate, aid or abet \noffenders. States Parties are required to adopt transnational bribery and illicit enrichment \nas domestic offences, and to ensure that adequate provision is made to facilitate the \nrequired forms of cooperation, such as mutual legal assistance and extradition.  Questions of transnational bribery and illicit enrichment are dealt with separately. Faced \nwith constitutional difficulties on the part of some states, those offences are made \nsubject to the Constitution and fundamental prin ciples of the legal system of each State \nParty, and acknowledge that constitutional constraints may preclude or limit full implementation. Where this is the case, and a State Party does not establish offences for those reasons, it is still obliged to assist and cooperate with other States Parties in such cases, \"…insofar as its laws permit.\" Transnational bribery and illicit enrichment are \ndesignated \"acts of corruption\", making them subject to the other provisions of the \ninstrument.  The transnational bribery provision requires that States Parties \"…shall prohibit and punish…\" the offering or granting of a bribe to a foreign Government official by anyone \nwho is a national, habitual resident, or a business domiciled in their territory\". The \nlanguage is broader than that of the equivalent provisions of the OECD Convention, covering not only bribery where the purpose relates to a contract or business transaction but also any other case where the bribe is connected to \"any act or omission in the performance of that official's public functions.\" The illicit enrichment provision simply \nrequires the establishment of an offence for the accumulation of a \"significant increase\" \nin assets by any public official if that official cannot reasonably explain the increase in relation to his or her lawful functions and earnings.  \n \n 106The foregoing criminalization requirements are essentially mandatory. In addition, States \nParties are also asked to consider a series of further offences that, if adopted, also become \"acts of corruption\" under the Convention, and trigger its cooperation \nrequirements even among states that have not adopted them: \n \na) The improper use of confidential information by an official; b) The improper use of Government property by an official; c) The seeking of any decision from a public authority for illicit gain; and d) The improper diversion of any state property, monies or securities. \n \nThe Convention creates a series of preventiv e measures although, as noted above, they \nare not mandatory:  \na) Standards of conduct for public functions and mechanisms to enforce them; \nb) The instruction of public personnel on ethical rules and their responsibilities; \nc) Systems for registering the incomes, assets and liabilities of those who perform public functions; d) Government revenue and control systems that deter corruption; e) Tax laws that deny favourable treatment for corruption-related expenditures; \nf) Protection for those who report corruption; \ng) Oversight bodies to prevent, detect, punish and eradicate corruption; and h) The study of further preventive measures. \n As with several other instruments, bank secrecy cannot be invoked as a reason for not cooperating, but where information protected by bank secrecy is disclosed, it cannot be \nused for purposes outside the scope of the initial request without authorization from the \nstate that provided it. The Convention does not require States Parties to create retroactive crimes but it does apply to acts of corruption committed before it came into force.  \nJ.  SOUTHERN AFRICAN DE VELOPMENT COMMUNITY (SADC) \nPROTOCOL ON CORRUPTION \n \nIn addition to defining and describing corruption as a problem, the purposes of the SADC \nProtocol on Corruption are threefold: to promote the development of anti-corruption mechanisms at the national level, to promote cooperation in the fight against corruption by States Parties, and to harmonise anti-corr uption national legislation in the region.  \n \nThe Protocol provides a wide set of pr eventive mechanisms which includes the \ndevelopment of codes of conduct for public officials, transparency in the public procurement of goods and services, access to public information, protection of whistle-blowers, establishment of anti-corrupti on agencies, the development of systems of \naccountability and control, participation of the media and civil society, and the use of public education and awareness as ways of introducing zero tolerance of corruption. \n \nK.  ECONOMIC COMMUNITY OF THE WEST AFRICAN STATES (ECOWAS) \nPROTOCOL ON THE FIGHT AGAINST CORRUPTION OF 2001 \n \nThe Member Sates signed the Protocol on the Fight Against Corruption in Dakar, Senegal, in December 2001. The aims and objectives of the Protocol are to:  \n \n 107 \ni)  promote and strengthen the development in each of the State Parties effective mechanisms to prevent, suppress and eradicate corruption,  \nii) intensify and revitalise cooperation between State Parties, with a view to \nmaking anti-corruption measures more effective, and  iii) promote the harmonization and coordination of national anti-corruption laws and policies. \n \n 108L.  CHAPTER 12; QUESTIONS FOR DISCUSSION \n \n12.1. You are asked by another country to  provide legal assistance. The country \ninforms you that they have no evidence against the person they are investigating \nbut that they suspect there may be evidence if they can get access to the person’s bank accounts in your country. What will you do? \n 12.1 You, yourself, need evidence from anot her country. Efforts to extradite the \nperson wanted for questioning have failed.  What will you do? \n \n12.2 Does your state have experience with co-operating with other States in the \ninvestigation and prosecuting of crimes?  If so, is it seen as efficient?  \n12.3 How many extradition treatises does your country have?  Are there strict limits to \nthe circumstances in which a suspect would be extradited to another country? \n \n12.4 Did your government have mutual assistance legislation in line prior to \nimplementing the UN convention?  If so, was it used often?  \n12.5 To what extent are you in a position to communicate with other countries in \ninvestigating and prosecuting crimes?  Do  you have ready access to an inventory \nof authorities of neighbouring countries which you can contact?    \n12.6 Do you know which countries are the most strategic in which to work with in \nprosecuting cases of corruption involving your country? What do you do with this \ninformation? \n \n12.7 What is the purpose of most requests for international cooperation being made \nby your country (i.e., asset recovery, extradition, investigation, etc)? What is the \npurpose of most requests for international cooperation that are made to your \ncountry \n \n12.8 In what ways, is the law enforcement system able to trace, seize, or forfeit assets \nfor asset recovery purposes from within your own country?  From other countries?   \n12.9 What channels are currently in place to pursue judicial cooperation in the form of \nestablishing contacts, etc.? Do you find these helpful? If not, what can be done to make them more efficient?   \n12.10 To what extent do you consider that you have enough knowledge about the \ndifferent restrictions that exist within other jurisdictions?  And those that exist \nbetween the  criminal and the civil law?  \n12.11 Are there rules or understandings which require that the other jurisdictions with \nwhich you have dealings must abide by previous case decisions and interpretations (i.e. be consistent?)?\n \n \n 109 \nCHAPTER 13 \n \nEXTRADITION \n \nArticle 44*56 \nExtradition \n1. This article shall apply to the offences est ablished in accordance with this Convention where \nthe person who is the subject of the request for extradition is present in  the territory of the \nrequested State Party, provided that the offenc e for which extradition is sought is punishable \nunder the domestic law of both the requesti ng State Party and the requested State Party. \n2. Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph 1 of this article, a State Party whose law so \npermits may grant the extradition of a person for an y of the offences covered by this Convention \nthat are not punishable under its own domestic law.  \n3. If the request for extradition includes severa l separate offences, at least one of which is \nextraditable under this article and some of which are not extraditable by reason of their period of \nimprisonment but are related to offences estab lished in accordance with this Convention, the \nrequested State Party may apply this articl e also in respect of those offences. \n4. Each of the offences to which this article applies shall be deemed to be included as an \nextraditable offence in any extradition treaty ex isting between States Parties. States Parties \nundertake to include such offences as extradit able offences in every extradition treaty to be \nconcluded between them. A State Party whose law so permits, in case it uses this Convention as \nthe basis for extradition, shall not consider any of the offences established in accordance with this \nConvention to be a political offence.  \n5. If a State Party that makes extradition conditi onal on the existence of a treaty receives a \nrequest for extradition from another State Party wi th which it has no extradition treaty, it may \nconsider this Convention the legal basis for extradi tion in respect of any offence to which this \narticle applies.  \n6. A State Party that makes extradition condit ional on the existence of a treaty shall: \n(a) At the time of deposit of its instrument of ra tification, acceptance or approval of or accession \nto this Convention, inform the Secretary-General of the United Nations whether it will take this \nConvention as the legal basis for cooperation on ex tradition with other States Parties to this \nConvention; and \n(b) If it does not take this Convention as the legal basis for cooperation on extradition, seek, \nwhere appropriate, to conclude treaties on extraditi on with other States Parties to this Convention \nin order to implement this article. \n7. States Parties that do not make extradition conditional on the existence of a treaty shall \nrecognize offences to which this article applie s as extraditable offences between themselves. \n8. Extradition shall be subject to the conditions provided for by the domestic law of the requested \nState Party or by applicable extradition treaties, in cluding, inter alia, conditions in relation to the \nminimum penalty requirement for extradition and the grounds upon which the requested State \nParty may refuse extradition. \n9. States Parties shall, subject to their do mestic law, endeavour to expedite extradition \nprocedures and to simplify evidentiary requirement s relating thereto in respect of any offence to \nwhich this article applies. \n10. Subject to the provisions of its domestic law and its extradition treat ies, the requested State \nParty may, upon being satisfied that the circum stances so warrant and are urgent and at the \nrequest of the requesting State Party, take a person whose extradition is sought and who is \npresent in its territory into custody or take ot her appropriate measures to ensure his or her \npresence at extradition proceedings. \n*UN CONVENTION AGAINST CORRUPTION  \n                                            \n56 For a further discussion, see “Extradition”, Tool # 42, UNODC Anti-Corruption Toolkit, Second Edition, \nFebruary 2004; http://www.unodc.org:80/pdf/crime/corr uption/toolkit/AC_Toolkit_Edition2.pdf  \n \n 110Article 44*57 \nExtradition  (continued) \n \n11. A State Party in whose territory an alleged offe nder is found, if it does not extradite such \nperson in respect of an offence to which this articl e applies solely on the ground that he or she is \none of its nationals, shall, at the request of t he State Party seeking extradition, be obliged to \nsubmit the case without undue delay to its compet ent authorities for the pur pose of prosecution. \nThose authorities shall take their decision and cond uct their proceedings in the same manner as \nin the case of any other offence of a grave natur e under the domestic law of that State Party. The \nStates Parties concerned shall cooperate wi th each other, in particular on procedural and \nevidentiary aspects, to ensure t he efficiency of such prosecution. \n12. Whenever a State Party is permitted under its domestic law to extradite or otherwise \nsurrender one of its nationals only upon the conditi on that the person will be returned to that State \nParty to serve the sentence imposed as a resu lt of the trial or proceedings for which the \nextradition or surrender of the person was so ught and that State Party and the State Party \nseeking the extradition of the person agree with this option and other terms that they may deem \nappropriate, such conditional extradition or su rrender shall be sufficient to discharge the \nobligation set forth in paragraph 11 of this article. \n13. If extradition, sought for purposes of enfor cing a sentence, is refused because the person \nsought is a national of the requested State Party,  the requested State Party shall, if its domestic \nlaw so permits and in conformity with the r equirements of such law, upon application of the \nrequesting State Party, consider the enforceme nt of the sentence imposed under the domestic \nlaw of the requesting State Party or the remainder thereof. \n14. Any person regarding whom proceedings are being carried out in connection with any of the \noffences to which this article applies shall be guaranteed fair treatment at all stages of the \nproceedings, including enjoyment of all the ri ghts and guarantees provided by the domestic law of \nthe State Party in the territory of which that person is present. \n15. Nothing in this Convention shall be interpre ted as imposing an obligation to extradite if the \nrequested State Party has substantial grounds for believing that the request has been made for \nthe purpose of prosecuting or punishing a person on  account of that person’s sex, race, religion, \nnationality, ethnic origin or political opinions or that compliance with the request would cause \nprejudice to that person’s positio n for any one of these reasons. \n16. States Parties may not refuse a request for extradition on the sole ground that the offence is \nalso considered to involve fiscal matters. \n17. Before refusing extradition, the requested St ate Party shall, where appropriate, consult with \nthe requesting State Party to provide it with ample opportunity to present its opinions and to \nprovide information relevant to its allegation. \n18. States Parties shall seek to conclude bilateral and multilateral agreements or arrangements \nto carry out or to enhance the effectiveness of extradition. \n \n*UN CONVENTION AGAINST CORRUPTION  \n \nA. INTRODUCTION \n \n“Extradition” is the surrender by one state, at the request of another, of a person who is \naccused or has been convicted of a crime committed within the jurisdiction of the requesting state. Although new forms of judici al cooperation in criminal matters have \nbeen developed, such as transfer of proceedings, “extradition for trial” has maintained its importance because the place where the offence was committed is considered the most \nconvenient place to try an offender.  \n                                            \n57 For a further discussion, see “Extradition”, Tool # 42, UNODC Anti-Corruption Toolkit, Second Edition, \nFebruary 2004; http://www.unodc.org:80/pdf/crime/corr uption/toolkit/AC_Toolkit_Edition2.pdf  \n \n 111When a suspect or convicted person is located in a foreign state (the “requested state”), \na prosecutor or investigating judge of the requesting state may decide to have that person extradited from the requested state to face trial or the enforcement of the \nsentence pronounced in the requesting state.  \n \nB.  LEGAL BASIS FOR EXTRADITION   1. From bilateral treaties to regional agreements and multilateral schemes for extradition \n \nThere is neither a legal nor a moral duty upon a state to extradite in the absence of a specific agreement binding it to do so. Because of this principle, many states, in particular those of the common law tradition, will not extradite in the absence of a treaty or an ad hoc agreement such as an Exchange of Letters. Those states, as well as many \nother states, have traditionally based their extr adition relationships on bilateral treaties. \nMany countries do not permit extradition for the purpose of questioning a fugitive or for their being investigated.58  With the inherent difficulties of separately negotiating a large number of bilateral \ninstruments, increasingly countries have resorted to regional agreements and \nmultilateral schemes for extradition. (The 50-odd countries of the Commonwealth, formerly the ”British” Commonwealth, have had their own collective arrangements for \nextradition since 1966.)   In the face of crimes with effects of international proportion, more general multilateral conventions have been developed, directed at particular crimes such as terrorist acts, drugs and organized crime. These conventions commonly \ninclude articles relating to extradition, such as the following:  \n \n• convention offences are deemed to be included as extraditable offences in any treaty \nexisting between Contracting Parties, \n• A convention is considered to be a treaty for extradition purposes, where extradition \nis conditional on a treaty and no treaty exists between two Contracting Parties, \n• The convention offences are considered extr aditable if extradition is not conditional \non a treaty.  \n• State parties are obliged either to extradite alleged offenders or to bring them before \ntheir own courts with jurisdiction based on e.g. the nationality of the offender (the \nprinciple of aut dedere aut judicare ). \n \n2. Extradition without a treaty \n \nSome states allow extradition without a treaty, on the basis of national legislation, which imposes in principle a condition of reciprocity. This is the basis for the Commonwealth Scheme, referred to above, which is not treaty-based.  \nIn a reply to the questionnaire prepared by the UN Secretariat-General on the United \nNations Declaration on Crime and Public Security over one half (sixteen out of twenty-six) of the responding states indicated that extradition for offences not covered by a \n                                            \n58  E.g. Chile has twice refused to extradite former  President Menem of Arg entina on the grounds that \nhe has not been charged with any criminal offence. \nhttp://support.casals.com/aaaflash1/ne w_busca.asp?ID_AAAControl=10450 \n \n 112treaty or to states where no treaty existed might be permitted on a discretionary basis, \nsubject to applicable domestic constitutional or legal constraints.   C.  EXTRADITABLE OFFENCES   1. From the “list” approach to the “eliminative” approach \n \nMost extradition treaties developed in the late 1800’s to the early-to-mid 1900’s defined extradition crimes by reference to a list of offences . Such lists are generally stagnant, \nand governments fail to bring them up to date to cover new crimes and changing \nterminologies as these emerge. To make matters worse, on occasions certain serious offences were omitted from the list from the outset. Where it is not possible to supplement the particular treaty by means of a Declaration of Reciprocity, a fugitive is likely to escape extradition.  \n \nIn more recent treaties this approach has generally given way to an “elimination” test: any offence punishable in both the requesting and the requested state, by a minimum penalty defined by the two states (such as two years’ imprisonment), is considered to be \nsufficiently serious as to warrant being an extraditable offence.   2. Relaxed application of the dual criminality principle \n \nFor extradition to be available, the act/s in question must constitute a crime in both the requesting and requested state. This rule serves two different purposes: first, to ensure the lawfulness of any form of deprivation of liberty according to the law of the requested \nstate on the grounds that no individual may be arrested or detained on account of facts \nwhich are not punishable under the laws of that state; and second, to respect the rule of reciprocity in international proceedings.   Many extradition cases fail because of a te chnical approach to dual criminality that \nstresses even very slight differences between the ways in which particular states have \ndefined, named or prove criminal offences. For example, what may be called “theft” in one state may be named “larceny” in another. Although the conduct of the alleged offence may include all of the elements of fraud, as defined in both states, the definitions of the offences created to counter them may differ. Therefore, states have been looking for a more modern test for dual criminality; one that focuses not on technical terms or \ndefinitions but on the substantive underlying conduct . This new test, which has greatly \nsimplified and improved extradition practice s where it has been introduced, examines \nwhether the conduct alleged against the fugitive would constitute a criminal offence in the requested state, regardless of whether the offences in the two states carry different names or have different constituent elements.  \n \nBut not all problems have been solved. In relation to the corruption of public officials the problem may arise where states only punish corruption of their own public officials, not that of public officials of other states. (If A requests B to extradite X, charged with corruption of a public official in A, B may not be able to extradite X because the facts, had they been committed on B’s territory, would not constitute an offence.) This has \nproved an obstacle to extradition in a number of cases.  \n A flexible solution is the ‘transformative’ interpretation, which is followed in such countries as Germany, Austria and the Netherlands. In this approach, the requested \n \n 113state substitutes its own national elements for foreign national elements in the definition \nof the crime in an extradition request. Accordingly, for the purpose of extradition, bribery of national and foreign public officials is treated as being the same.   D.  BARS AND LIMITS TO EXTRADITION   1. The “Political offence” and the “fiscal offence” exceptions \n \nThere is no internationally accepted criteria or de finition of the term “political offence” or \nthe rule that bars extradition for such an offence.  \n A distinction is often made between “purely political offences” (offences of opinion, political expression or those which otherwise do not involve the use of violence such as treason and espionage) and “relative political offences” (which involve violence as an \nincidence of the political motivation and goal of the actor, but which do not constitute \nwanton or indiscriminate violence directed against an internationally protected person, such as a civilian, i.e. it does not constitute an act of “terrorism”).   In the Inter-American Convention Against Corruption of 1996 it is provided that, for the \npurposes of extradition and mutual legal assistance, “the fact that the property obtained \nor derived from an act of corruption was intended for political purposes, or that it is alleged that an act of corruption was committed for political motives or purposes, shall \nnot suffice in and of itself   to qualify the act as a political offence or as a common offence \nrelated to a political offence.” This is seen as an important provision in a region where corrupt senior public officials had prev iously been known to flee in to neighbouring \ncountries with vast sums of money and to be given political asylum there. \n There is a general trend towards restricting, if not excluding altogether, the applicability of the political offence exception in respect to violent criminal acts. Traditionally, fiscal offences have been omitted from the scope of extraditable crimes, either through an \nexplicit provision or by omission from  the lists of extraditable offences.  \n The traditional reluctance of countries to refuse to include tax offences within the scope of extradition (for the most part because states have no mutual interest in enforcing law peculiar to other state’s political-economic system) is now breaking down owing to increased concerns about organized crime, dr ug trafficking, money laundering, massive \ntax evasion, and violations of currency la ws. The UN Convention Against Transnational \nOrganized Crime explicitly prohibits States Parties from refusing a request for extradition \non the sole ground that the offence is also considered to involve fiscal matters. \n \n2. Non extradition of nationals \n \nIn many states, particularly of the civil law tradition, the extradition of a state’s own nationals is prohibited, whether by constitutional law or practice. In their replies to a questionnaire prepared by the UN Secretariat-General on the United Nations Declaration on Crime and Public Security\n9, only fourteen of the twenty-eight responding \nstates indicated that their law allowed for the extradition of their nationals. The position \ndiffered greatly among the states that allowed for this, the matter being governed by \ntreaties or agreements. Attitudes to extradition appear to be softening, particularly in Western Europe, where the rights of extradited persons are protected by a regional human rights convention. \n \n 114  \nIn most instances, countries that do not extradite nationals have domestic jurisdiction to prosecute their own nationals for offences committed in the territory of another state \n(“judicare  “ instead of “ dedere ”). In their replies to a questionnaire prepared by the UN \nSecretariat-General on the United Nations Declaration on Crime and Public Security\n10, \nsixteen of the states that responded to the survey indicated that their laws provided for obligatory or discretionary jurisdiction in such cases. Preconditions for such jurisdiction varied in accordance with general factors, such as national criminal legislation, applicable treaties and case-specific factors, such as the nature of the crime and the \nadmissibility of evidence.  \n Notwithstanding, practical problems continue significantly to impede the effectiveness of \nthis alternative to extradition. It often seems to be the case that, despite best efforts to complete investigations and bring a case to trial, an adequate case cannot be \nassembled. Foreign witnesses may not be available or other evidence may be \ninsufficient or inadmissible. Ten out of the eighteen responding states reported that between 1996 and 1998, having refused extradition, they had subsequently prosecuted their own nationals on the grounds of aut dedere aut judicare . One solution is for \nlegislation to provide for the conditional extradition of a national, subject to the \nrequirement that he or she be returned promptly  after trial to the extraditing country to \nserve any sentence there.  \n \n3. Other bars \n \nWhere the defence of “double jeopardy”  is contained in a treaty , its success will depend \nlargely on the similarity of the charges for which the fugitive has been requested and for \nwhich he has been already prosecuted, acquitted or convicted. Most treaties contain a defence to extradition where the prosecution at issue is barred by a statute of limitations of the requested or requesting state. The treaties vary as which country’s statute is to be relied upon, or whether it is the longer of the two. In recent years the Member States of \nthe European Union have initiated a process in which many such barriers have been \nreconsidered. Among other things, this has led to a lessening of the severity of the rule prohibiting extradition where, under the law of the requested state, the individual is immune from prosecution or punishment by reason of lapse of time.  Other, more recent, barriers focus on the situation of a fugitive after extradition, such as \nthe “non-discrimination” rule.\n In instances in which the ambit of the political offence \nexception is either limited or eliminated, t he rule relating to discrimination has to be \nrelied upon more heavily than usual. Other conc erns highlight the possible application of \nthe death penalty, or likely violations of basic human rights.   4. Specialty rule \n \nIt is an established principle in extradition law that a person who has been extradited may not be proceeded against, sentenced or detained for any offence committed prior to his surrender other than that for which he was surrendered. Nor can he or she be restricted in their personal freedom for any other reason, other than with the consent of \nthe requested state or of the extradited person. This so-called principle of “specialty” not \nonly protects the fugitive’s rights to the extent that it prevents the fugitive from being requested for one offence and tried for another. It also upholds the contractual nature of \n \n 115the agreement between the two states, in that the requesting state has to accept that the \nrequested state has granted extradition for the offences specified, and not for others.   E.  PROCEDURAL ISSUES   1. A slow and cumbersome system \n \nInternational conventions and treaties usually  include very few provisions on procedural \nissues. These are left to be governed largely by the national laws of the states involved.  \n \nThe traditional system for applying for mutual legal assistance is somewhat complex:   A two-stage system in the requesting state : The authorities of the requesting state \nforward a request for a fugitive’s extradition to the authorities of the requested state. The \nrequest usually originates with the prosecuting authority with jurisdiction in the criminal \ncase in question (public prosecutor or court), and is formalized and prepared for transmission by the responsible administrative authority of the requesting state. This is \nfollowed by the use of diplomatic channels:  The administrative authority of the \nrequesting state generally transmits the request to its embassy in the requested state, \nwhich forwards the request on to the requested state’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs. That \nMinistry then forwards it to its Ministry of Justice, which then sends it on to the appropriate prosecuting office or court, depending upon that country’s legal system.   Then follows a two stage-system in the requested state: In the requested state the \nprocedure can be divided into two stages. First, t here is a judicial stage, in which a court \ndecides on whether the domestic legal requi rements for the extradition of the person \nhave been met.  The second is administrative. Where the court has found in favour of the request, the responsible administrative authority (e.g. Minister of Justice) has to decide whether or not the extradition will be granted. The judiciary examines whether the legal requirements in the treaty or in domestic legislation have been met, but \nextradition itself remains a prerogative of the government, as an act of state. The \nadministrative authority of the requested st ate takes the final decision and informs the \nauthorities of the requested state of its decision through diplomatic channels.  \n \n2. Extradition proceedings are not themselves deemed to be criminal proceedings \n The rules of procedure applicable to crimi nal cases are usually not applicable to \nextradition cases, other than “due process” and “fundamental fairness” requirements.  A long-standing “rule of non-inquiry” requires that it is not for a court to take into account the likely treatment of a fugitive if he or she is extradited to the requesting country. The \nassessment of such grounds is usually left to the discretion of the administrative \nauthority. That authority also has the power to require the requesting state to provide any necessary assurances before extraditing the fugitive. These might include undertakings for the return of that person upon completion of the legal proceedings, that the fugitive will not be tried before a special or military tribunal, or that the death penalty will not be imposed in the event of a conviction for a capital offence \n. \nThe issue of the evidence to be provided by t he foreign state in support of an extradition \nrequest remains contentious, particularly as between civil and common law countries.   \n \n 116For civil law countries, the issuing of a warrant of arrest within a requesting state \nconstitutes evidence that a judicial authority within that state has determined that there is sufficient evidence for the person to stand trial. On that basis, they expect the authorities \nin the requested state to be able to accept and rely on that determination, and not to look \nbehind it to reassess the underlying basis for the finding.   By contrast, however, common law countries have traditionally required not only that the warrant be provided but also that a submissi on of evidence by the foreign state be made \nthat is sufficient to meet a prescribed dom estic standard. Many such states also demand \nthat, before extradition can be granted, the evidence be in a form that complies with their \nown domestic law. To meet this burden the requesting authorities can be required to generate an entirely new package of evidence that they would not normally put together and which might not be used (or perhaps even be useable) in any ultimate domestic trial process, against the fugitive. The same problem can also arise between countries with \nthe same general traditions but with differing rules of evidence and differing approaches \nto extradition.   Considerable reform has been achieved in th is area. Several common law countries \n(such as Australia and the United Kingdom) have eliminated the requirement for \nevidence in prescribed circumstances. Others (such as the United States) have adopted \na lower threshold of proof and will accept evidence adduced in a summary form, without requiring that the evidence meet their ow n normal evidentiary standards. To the extent \nthat there remain states that require the submission of evidence in a form admissible \nunder domestic law, there is still the need to develop ways and means of reducing the burden of needlessly demanding evidentiary requirements. Enhanced communication \nbetween the relevant authorities in the different states in order to increase understanding \ncan help to ameliorate this.  \n \n3. Modernization and simplification of the procedure \n \na.  Provisional arrest \nMore recent international instruments\n provide that, prior to the filing of a formal \nextradition request, a requesting state may request the provisional arrest of a fugitive. Provisional arrest can be necessary to avoid the risk of the fugitive disappearing while the extradition request and accompanying documentation is being prepared by the requesting state. Existing treaties provide for periods of up to sixty days of provisional \narrest, after which a fugitive must be released if no formal extradition request is \npresented.   The mechanics of provisional arrest are essentially informal. The liaison office of Interpol, usually located within the principal or central law enforcement agency of each \nInterpol Member State, sends a message to the Interpol liaison office in the state where \nthe person is believed to be located. If the whereabouts of the person sought are unknown, the Interpol Headquarters (in Lyon, France) then issues an “international warrant” (a so-called “red notice”), or an “alert”, or both, to some or all of its liaison stations. A study carried out by Interpol’s General Secretariat in 1997, showed that a majority of the Organization’s member countries consider that an Interpol “red notice” is \nregarded as being a valid request for provisional arrest. Immigration and customs \nagencies are also advised of the request.  \n \n 117The rapidly growing computerization of law enforcement agencies means that these \nnotifications are generally recorded promptly  in the databases of the different law \nenforcement agencies, leading to greater effectiveness in tracking and apprehending \nfugitives.  \n Reasons for not executing requests for provisional arrests include:  \ni)   an inability to locate the subject;  ii)  a failure of the request to satisfy legislative or constitutional requirements in \nthe requested state;  \niii)  a lack of information sufficient to determine whether the request meets \napplicable requirements;  \niv)  the withdrawal of the request;  v)  the absence of dual criminality; and  vi)  the lack of a treaty or relevant national law applicable to the requesting state.  \n \nWhere states permit direct requests for pr ovisional arrest, additional conditions are \nusually applied.   \nb. Direct contact between ministries of justice or through designated central authorities \nAt the regional level, the reliance on the diplomatic channel for the communication of \nextradition requests has given rise to unnec essary delays whereas direct contact \nbetween Ministries of Justice or through designated central authorities have\n offered \nmore satisfactory alternatives. As with Mutual Legal Assistance, central authorities are usually established to receive and consider extradition requests. Such authorities serve as a point of contact between Governments, assessing incoming requests in order to \nrefer them to the appropriate domestic agencies for follow-up or drawing the attention of \na requesting state to any problems or insufficiencies.   Although changes in many of these areas can only be brought about by legislation and appropriate treaty revision, other significant improvements can be facilitated more \nsimply. In the course of its presidency of the European Communities in 1992, the United \nKingdom initiated discussions with other Member States, which resulted in agreement on several practical steps that could be taken to remove avoidable delays. A number of improvements resulted, including the publication of a guide to the extradition procedures of the states concerned. These contain flow charts, a list of contact points and other information of a practical nature. In 1994, the Secretariat of the Council of Europe was \ngiven the task of extending this text to include all parties to the 1957 European \nConvention on Extradition.   Such initiatives do not necessarily require a regional or sub-regional setting. For example, the preparation of a practical guide to domestic extradition law and practice \ncan be undertaken unilaterally and distributed by the central authority to states with \nwhich there are existing extradition agreements, or to all parties to the 1988 Convention. \nThe availability of such a practical explanatory note is also of value in the preliminary \nstages of extradition treaty negotiations with states that have little or no experience of local requirements\n. \n c. Use of modern means of communication \nA concern with administrative efficiency is evident in the many precedents that authorize \nthe use of electronic means of communication.  \n \n 118d. Simplified extradition procedures \nIn recent years a development that has also commanded attention is the provision for \nsummary or simplified procedures to expedite the extradition process when the fugitive  \ndoes contest extradition. Where the fugitive consents to extradition, surrender may be \nenforced without any other formalities always provided that consent has been freely given. This approach has been adopted in a number of regional arrangements including the Benelux Treaty of 1962, the 1990 Schengen Convention and the 1995 Convention on Simplified Extradition Procedure between the Member States of the European Union. It is also found in Article 6 of the Model Treaty on Extradition, adopted in 1990 by the \nGeneral Assembly of the UN. \n \n 119F. CHAPTER 13; QUESTIONS FOR DISCUSSION \n \n13.1 A neighbouring country wants to extradite one of its nationals from your country \nwho is there illegally. There are no ex tradition arrangements. The suggestion is \nmade that you might take the person to the border and hand him over to your \nneighbours as an unwanted immigrant. What would you do? What would you not \ndo? \n 13.2. You are negotiating a Mutual Legal Assistance Treaty. Your opposite number \nsuggests that it should include a requirement that senior officials who had fled \nthe country and are wanted for corruption should be extradited even if they would \notherwise have been given political asylum.  How would you respond? What would be the reasons you would give to justify the position you were taking? \n 13.3 In the same negotiations you are dealing with a country whose constitution \nprohibits the extradition of nationals to other countries. Would you suggest that \nthe same prohibition be written in to the Treaty to protect your own citizens in this \nway? If not, why not? If so, why?  \n 13. 4   Your country receives a request for extradition of a person on the grounds that \nthey want to prosecute the person for tax offences. How would you respond? \nWhat would be the policy reasons behind your response? \n 13.5    The requesting country seeks the extraditi on of a person in your country that they \nclaim is a dangerous terrorist. You know that the requesting country has been criticised for torture during interrogations and other human rights abuses of prisoners. Due to the seriousness of the charge the person is likely to receive the \ndeath penalty in the requesting state if found guilty.  What should be done?  \n 13.6   You have requested the extradition of a person on the grounds of an armed \nrobbery. When the person is extradited you find evidence that the person has also committed a murder. What do you do? What would you not do? What would \nbe the policy positions behind your actions?  \n 13.7 Can nationals of your country be extradited to other countries and if yes, are  \nthere any specific conditions that need to be applied for this to happen ?  \n \n \n 120 \nCHAPTER 14 \n \nMUTUAL LEGAL ASSISTANCE \n \n \nA. INTRODUCTION \n Mutual legal assistance\n59 is an international cooperation process by which states seek and \nprovide assistance in gathering evidence for use in the investigation and prosecution of criminal cases, and, in tracing, freezing, seiz ing and ultimately confiscating criminally derived \nwealth. It covers a wide and ever-expanding range of assistance. It may include search and seizure; production of documents; taking of witness statements by video-conference; and \ntemporary transfer of prisoners or other witnesses to give evidence. \n It differs from traditional cooperation between law enforcement agencies. Law enforcement cooperation enables a wide range of intelligence and information sharing, including that of witnesses providing they agree to give informat ion, documents or other evidentiary materials \nvoluntarily. If a witness is unwilling, coercive m easures will be needed, usually in the form of a \ncourt order from a judicial officer.  It also differs from extradition, although many of the legal principles underlying mutual legal assistance are derived from extradition law and pr actice. Extradition involves the surrender of \na person from one sovereign jurisdiction to anot her and fundamentally affects the liberty and \npossibly life of that person. Accordingly, extradition law, practice and procedure typically \nenable less flexibility and room for discretion in granting a request than mutual legal assistance.  A United Nations expert working group (EWG) brought together in Vienna in December 2001 \nrecommended that states take the following actions in order to facilitate the providing of \neffective mutual legal assistance. For the purpose of this Handbook  only a few relevant points \nare mentioned:   \nB.  STRENGTHENING EFFECTIVENESS OF CENTRAL AUTHORITIES  \n \n1. Establishment of effective central authorities  \n \nThe United Nations Conventions on drugs and crim e all contain extensive and broadly similar \nprovisions relating to the provision of mutual legal assistance. Included in their provisions are requirements for each Party to notify the Secretary-General of the United Nations of the \n“central authority” designated by it to receive, transmit and execute Letters of Request for \nmutual legal assistance. This is critical information for requesting states in planning and drawing up requests. It must be accurate, up-to- date and widely available to all those who frame or transmit mutual legal assistance requests. States that have not already done so should establish a central authority for the purpose of facilitating the making of requests for mutual legal assistance made under Article 7 of the United Nations Convention Against Illicit \n                                            \n59 For a further discussion, see “Mutual Legal Assi stance”, Tool # 43, UNODC Anti-Corruption Toolkit, \nSecond Edition, February 2004; \nhttp://www.unodc.org:80/pd f/crime/corruption/toolkit/AC_Toolkit_Edition2.pdf  \n \n 121Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances of 1988  (the 1988 Convention)60 and \naddressed to other States Parties, and for it to execute promptly requests received from other \nStates Parties. Central authorities should be staffed with practitioners who are legally trained \nand who have developed institutional expertise in the area of mutual legal assistance. The \ndesignation of authorities with important national drug control capability in other fields (e.g., health ministries), but little if any in international mutual legal assistance, should be avoided. \n \n2. Ensuring the dissemination of up-to-date contact information \n Parties to the 1988 Convention should ensure that contact information contained in the United \nNations Directory of competent authorities under article 7 of the Convention is kept up to date, and, to the extent possible, provide information for contacting its central authority via phone, fax and Internet. \n \n3. Ensuring round-the-clock availability  \nBoth with respect to the 1988 Convention and generally, the central authority of a state should, to the greatest extent possible, provide a means for contacting an official of the central authority for the purposes of executing an emergency request for mutual legal assistance if \nnecessary after working hours. If no other reliable means is available, states may consider \nensuring that their Interpol National Central Bu reau or other existing channel is able to reach \nsuch an official after working hours. \n \n4. Consistency of central authorities   \n The EWG noted the wide and growing range of international conventions, each requiring \nParties to afford one another the widest measure of  mutual legal assistance in relation to the \noffences covered by the particular convention, and each requiring for that purpose the designation of a central authority. The EWG noted the potential for the fragmentation of effort and for inconsistencies of approach if different central authorities are designated for different \ngroups of offences. States are therefore urged to ensure that their central authorities under the \n1988 Convention, the UN Convention on Transnational Organized Crime of 2000 , are a single \nentity of the kind described in this section. This will make it easier for other states to contact the appropriate component for all kinds of mutual legal assistance in criminal matters, and will facilitate greater consistency of mutual legal assi stance practice for different kinds of criminal \noffences.  5. Reducing delay \n \nThe EWG noted that significant delay in the execution of a request is often caused by delays in consideration of the request by the receiving central authority and the transmission of the \nrequest by the central authority to the appropriate executing authority. States should take \nappropriate action to ensure that requests are examined and prioritized by central authorities promptly upon receipt, and transmitted to execut ing authorities without delay. States should \nconsider placing time limits upon processing of requests by central authorities. States are \nencouraged to afford foreign requests the same priority as similar domestic investigations or proceedings. States should also ensure that executing agencies do not unreasonably delay \nprocessing of requests. Appropriate coordination arrangements should be in place in federal \n                                            \n60 http://www.incb.org/e/conv/1988/articles.htm   \n \n 122jurisdictions where constituent states have execut ion responsibilities to minimize the risk of \ndelayed responses.  C.  ENSURING AWARENESS OF NATIONAL LEGAL REQUIREMENTS AND BEST \nPRACTICE  \n \nThere is a need to increase the availability of practical guides regarding the national mutual \nlegal assistance legal framework and practice  (both domestic manuals and guides for foreign \ncentral authorities). It is important that domestic authorities be aware of the availability of \nmutual legal assistance and know the procedures to follow to obtain that assistance in relation \nto an investigation or prosecution. It is also very useful, particularly in larger jurisdictions, where there may be several authorities involved in the making or execution of such requests, to provide for the sharing of information between those authorities.  \nStates should adopt mechanisms to allow for the dissemination of information, regarding the \nlaw, practice and procedures for mutual legal assistance and on making requests to other states, to domestic authorities. One possible approach is to develop a procedural manual or guide for distribution to relevant law enforcement, prosecutorial and judicial authorities. Other useful mechanisms include the distribution of a regular newsletter and the convening of \ndomestic practitioners meetings to provide updates on cases, legislation and other \ndevelopments.  The provision of information to foreign authorities was also highlighted as an important measure to facilitate effective cooperation. States should develop guidelines on domestic law and procedures relating to mutual legal assistance to inform foreign authorities on the \nrequirements that must be met to obtain assistance. Any such guidelines should be made \navailable to foreign central authorities through a variety of methods, such as, for example, publication on a website, direct transmission to law enforcement partners in other states and distribution through the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime or other international organizations.  1. Increasing training of personnel involved in the mutual legal assistance process \n \nEffective implementation of mutual legal assistance instruments and legislation is not possible without personnel well trained in the applicable laws, principles and practices. States should use a broad range of methods to provide such training, in a manner that will allow for the \nexpertise to be sustained, for example: \n \na)  Lectures and presentations by central authorities as part of regular training courses or \nworkshops for law enforcement, prosecutors, magistrates or other judicial authorities; \nb)  Special workshops or seminars on a domestic, regional or multi-jurisdictional basis; \nc)  Introducing programmes on mutual legal assistance as part of the curriculum for law \nschools or continuing legal education programmes; and \nd)  Exchanges of personnel between central authorities of various jurisdictions. \n  \n \n 123D.  EXPEDITING COOPERATION THROUGH THE USE OF ALTERNATIVES WHEN \nAPPROPRIATE  \n \n1. Using police channels where formal coercive measures are not required  \nThe EWG emphasized that, except for coercive measures normally requiring judicial authorisation, formal mutual legal assistance will  not always be necessary to obtain assistance \nfrom other states. Whenever possible, informat ion or intelligence should initially be sought \nthrough police-to-police contact, which is faster, cheaper and more flexible than the more \nformal route of mutual legal assistance. Such contact can be carried out through \nICPO/Interpol, Europol, through local crime liaison officers, under any applicable memoranda of understanding, or through any regional arrangements that are available. \n \n2. Where evidence is voluntarily given or is publicly available \n \nWhile as a general rule police-to-police contact cannot be used to obtain coercive measures for the sole benefit of the requesting state, it may be used to obtain voluntarily given evidence, and evidence from public records or other publicly available sources. Again, the method has the advantage of being faster and more reactive than formal requests. Certain categories of \nevidence or information may also be obtained di rectly from abroad without the need for police \nchannels, for example publicly available inform ation stored on the Internet or in other \nrepositories of public records. \n \n3. Accelerating an effective response to urgent formal requests \n Many states will permit very urgent requests  to be made orally or by fax between law \nenforcement officers so that advance preparations can be made or urgent non-coercive assistance given, at the same time as a formal request is routed between the two central authorities. \n \n4. Informing the central authority of prior informal contacts  \nThe formal request should state that a copy has been sent by an informal route to avoid duplication of work. Similarly, where there has been prior police-to-police contact, the Letter of Request should state this and give brief details. \n \n5. Using of joint investigation teams  \nStates should use joint investigation teams between officers of two or more states where there is a transnational aspect to the offence, for exam ple in facilitating controlled deliveries of drugs \nor in cross border surveillance operations. States should make full use of the benefits of the \nexchange of financial intelligence (in accordance with appropriate safeguards) between \nagencies responsible for the collating of financial transaction data and, where necessary, develop or enact the appropriate enabling legislation. \n \n \n 124E.  MAXIMISING EFFECTIVENESS THROUGH DIRECT PERSONAL CONTACT \nBETWEEN CENTRAL AUTHORITIES OF REQUESTING AND REQUESTED STATES  \n \n1. Maintaining direct contact throughout all stages of the request   \nAn earlier review had stressed the importance of personal contacts to achieve open communication channels and to develop the familiarity and trust necessary to achieve the best results in mutual legal assistance casework. The EWG reaffirmed that personal contact between members of central authorities, prosec utors and investigators from the requesting \nand requested states remains crucially important at every stage of the mutual assistance \nprocess. To facilitate this, contact details, including phone, fax and, where available, email addresses, of the responsible officials, should be clearly stated within the Letter of Request. Sometimes it may be desirable to establish contact with the official in the requested state before sending the request in order to clarify legal requirements or simplify procedures. Such \ncontact can be initiated through the police-to-police means listed above, including through \nexisting police attaché networks, or between prosecutors or staff of central authorities, through the UNDCP list of competent authorities, through networks such as the European Justice Network of the European Union, or through less formal structures such as the International Association of Prosecutors or simply personal contacts.  2. Benefits of Liaison Magistrates, Prosecutors and Police Officers \n \nThe EWG also encouraged states to take initiatives such as exchanges of liaison police officers, magistrates or prosecutors with states with which there is significant mutual legal assistance traffic. This can be done either by posting a permanent member of staff to the \ncentral authority of that country, or by a rranging short-term exchanges of staff. Experience \nshows that such \"on-site\" initiatives produce faster and more useful mutual legal assistance than is usually possible when dealing from a \"distance\". \n \nF.  PREPARING MLA REQUESTS  \n \nMutual legal assistance (MLA) is one of the most important weapons the justice system has against serious international crime. Requests often need to be generated at very short notice \nand in ways that avoid the legal pitfalls and obs tacles that exist when different legal systems \nare trying to lend each other their criminal justice powers.  In response to this need the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime’s Legal Advi sory Programme is developing a computer-\nbased mutual legal assistance request drafting utility to help practitioners streamline the \nprocess of making requests.61  The new drafting tool will guide casework practitioners through the preparation of Letters of Requests with a series of templates.  Caseworkers fill in the various data fields and make \nselections  from drop-down menus in each template in order to prepare requests.  The \nprogramme will not allow users to move from one section to the next until all of the information is fully and correctly entered. This will ensure that requests will not be rejected due to errors or omissions.  When completed, the programme will automatically generate a correct, complete and effective request The programme will also give access to relevant multilateral, bilateral, regional treaties and agreements and national laws, and include a case management tracking \nsystem for incoming and outgoing requests. \n                                            \n61  Details will be given on the UNDOC webs ite when the facility bec omes available (http//: \nwww.unodc.org)  \n \n 125 \nThe preparation of a request for assistance involves the consideration of a number of requirements, including treaty provisions (where applicable), domestic law, and the \nrequirements of the requested state. Too meticulous attention to detail, however, could result \nin a request that was unduly lengthy, or was so prescriptive that it prevented the requested state from using alternative methods to securing the desired end result. Those preparing requests should apply the following basic principles: \n a)   Be very specific in presentation; \nb)  Link the existing investigation or proceedings to the assistance required; \nc)   Specify the precise assistance sought, and d)  Focus, where possible, on the end-result and not on the method of securing that \nend-result (for example, it may be possible for the requested state to obtain the evidence by means of a production or other  court order, rather than by means of \na search warrant: if you ask for a search warrant and the local law does not allow \nfor this, you risk a failed request.) \ne) To assist in the application of the above principles, the EWG has developed \nchecklists and tools for use in preparing requests. The checklists set out both the requirements generally expected of requests and additional specific requirements \nfor certain areas of assistance.  \n \n \nG.  ELIMINATING OR REDUCING IMPEDIMENTS TO EXECUTION OF REQUESTS IN \nTHE REQUESTED STATE  \n \n1. Interpreting legal requirements flexibly  \nIn general, states should strive to provide extensive cooperation so as to ensure that national law enforcement authorities are not impeded in pursuing criminals who seek to shield their actions by spreading the evidence and the pr oceeds of their crimes across different \njurisdictions. As described below, states should  examine whether their current framework for \nproviding assistance gives rise to any unnecessary impediments to cooperation and, to the extent possible, reduce or eliminate them. In ad dition, those preconditions to the provision of \ncooperation that are retained should be interpreted liberally in favour of cooperation; the terms \nof applicable laws and treaties should not be applied in an unduly rigid way that impedes, rather than facilitates, the granting of assistance.  2. Minimizing grounds for refusal and exercising them sparingly \n \nIf assistance is to be rendered as extensively as possible between states, the grounds upon which a request may be refused should be minimal, limited to protections that are fundamental \nto the requested state. Many of the existing grounds of refusal in mutual legal assistance are a \n\"carry over\" from extradition law and practice, w here the life or liberty of the target may be \nmore directly and immediately at stake. States should carefully examine such existing grounds of refusal to determine if it is necessary to retain them for mutual legal assistance.   An area of particular concern is dual criminality. Opinions are divided, with some states \nrequiring dual criminality for all requests, some for compulsory measures only, some having \ndiscretion to refuse on that basis where it is absent, and some with neither the requirement nor the discretion to refuse. Because of the problems that can arise from the application of the concept of dual criminality to mutual legal assistance, the EWG recommended that states \n \n 126consider restricting or eliminating the application of the principle, in particular where it is at \npresent a mandatory precondition. Problems can also arise from the application of the ne bis \nin idem  principle. Article 14-7 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights \n(ICCPR) (as do numerous countries’ constitutions) states that no one shall be liable to be tried \nor punished again for an offence for which he has already been finally convicted or acquitted. Ne bis in idem  frequently features as grounds for refusal of assistance.  \n States applying this ground for refusal should use a flexible and creative approach so as to minimize the circumstances where assistance is likely to be refused. For example, they should \nbe prepared to accept an undertaking that a requesting state will not prosecute a person who \nhas already been prosecuted in respect of the same conduct in the requested state, where assistance is being sought for a person to aid investigations in the requesting state. Some states do not apply this ground for refusal at all, and other states may wish to consider whether it is possible for them to adopt such a course of action. Grounds for refusal should \nonly be invoked when it is absolutely unavoidable. \n \n3. Reducing use limitations \n \nTraditionally, evidence transmitted in response to a request for mutual legal assistance cannot \nbe used for purposes not described in the request unless the requesting state has contacted \nthe requested state and asked for express consent to other uses. In order to avoid cumbersome requirements that are often not rea lly necessary, many states provide for a more \nstreamlined approach in their mutual legal assi stance practices. For example, many modern \nmutual legal assistance treaties require a requested state to advise if it wishes to impose a specific use limitation; if the advisory is not stated as being necessary, there will be no \nlimitation as to use. Such methods provide adequate control for the requested state in \nimportant cases and at the same time facilitate efficiency in the many cases that are not sensitive.  \n \n4. Ensuring confidentiality in appropriate cases \n \nSome states are not in a position to maintain the confidentiality of requests, and the contents of requests have on occasions been disclosed to the subjects of the foreign investigation/ proceedings, thereby potentially prejudicing th e investigation/proceedings. Confidentiality of \nrequests is often a critical factor in the execution of requests. Accordingly, the EPG recommended that where a specific request is made, the requested state should take \nappropriate measures to ensure that the confidentiality of the request is maintained. In \ncircumstances where it is not possible to maintain confidentiality under the law of the requested state, the requested state should notify the requesting state at the earliest possible opportunity and, in any case, prior to the execution of the request, to allow the requesting state to decide if it wishes to continue with the request in the absence of confidentiality.  5. Execution of requests in accordance with procedures specified by the requesting State \n \nIt is important to comply with all of the form al evidentiary/admissibility requirements stipulated \nby the requesting state to ensure that a request achieves its purpose. It has been noted that \nfailure to comply with such requirements often makes it impossible to use the evidence in the \nproceedings in the requesting state, or at th e least, causes delay, (for example where the \nrequested material has to be returned to the requested state for certification/authentication in accordance with the request). The requested state should make every effort to achieve \n \n 127compliance with specified procedures and formalities to the extent that such \nprocedures/formalities are not contrary to the domestic law of the requested state. States are also encouraged to consider whether domestic laws relating to the reception of evidence can \nbe made more flexible so as to overcome problems with the use of evidence gathered in a \nforeign state. \n \n6. Coordination in multi-jurisdictional cases \n \nIncreasingly, there are cases in which more than one state has jurisdiction over some or all of \nthe participants in a crime. In some cases, it will be most effective for the states concerned to \nchoose a single venue for prosecution; in others, it may be best for one state to prosecute some participants while one or more other states pursue the remainder. In general, coordination in such multi-jurisdictional cases may avoid a multiplicity of requests for mutual legal assistance from each state with jurisdiction. Where there are multiple requests for \nassistance in the same case, states are encouraged to closely consult in order to avoid \nneedless confusion and duplication of effort.  \n \n7. Reducing the complexity of mutual legal assistance through reform of extradition processes \n \nTraditionally, some states have refused to extradite their nationals for trial abroad. A number of countries have provisions in their constitutions prohibiting this practice. Whereas in the past it was defensible as a general rule, today with an increasing number of states subjected to the human rights jurisdictions of regional and other courts, the claim that a fair trial can only be guaranteed in the country of nationality has lost much of its force.  \n \nOn occasions, however, such states are prepared to prosecute their nationals in their own courts, resulting in lengthy and complex requests for mutual legal assistance to obtain the necessary evidence from the country where the crime took place. Recent increases in the \nnumber of states that will either extradite thei r own nationals or who will temporarily extradite \nthem on the basis that any sentence can be served in the state of nationality, reduce the need \nfor the additional mutual legal assistance requests that would otherwise be needed. The remaining states that do not extradite national s should consider whether  this impediment can \nbe reduced or eliminated. If this is not possible, the states concerned should seek to coordinate with a view to ensuring an effectiv e domestic prosecution in lieu of extradition. \n \n8. Cooperation with respect to confiscation (enforcement of civil forfeiture, asset \nsharing) \n \nThere are particular impediments to assistance with respect to the freezing/seizure and confiscation of proceeds of crime. As noted in the report of the EWG in relation to \nfreezing/seizure, it can be difficult to obtain assistance on the urgent basis required because of \ndelays inherent in the mutual legal  assistance process. Problems also arise because of the \ndiffering approaches to the execution of mutual legal assistance requests and varying systems for confiscation. The 1988 Convention permits a state to comply with a request for freezing/ seizure or confiscation by directly enforcing the foreign order or by initiating proceedings in \norder to obtain a domestic order.  \n \nAs a result the policies adopted can differ as between states. Furthermore, the states that do obtain domestic orders do so on the basis of vary ing domestic asset confiscation regimes. In \nsome states there is a requirement to provide evidence of a connection between the particular \n \n 128property sought to be confiscated and a criminal offence. Other states employ a “value” or \n“benefit” concept whereby there need only be evidence that the property is linked to a person who has been accused or convicted of a crim e, and then the order is enforced directly. \nExperience in this area clearly demonstrates that the direct enforcement approach is much \nless resource intensive, avoids duplication of evidence provision and court findings, and is significantly more effective in affording the assistance sought on a timely basis. The EWG \nstrongly recommended that states that have not  done so already should adopt legislation to \npermit the direct enforcement of foreign orders for freezing/seizure and confiscation. In the interim, where a state is seeking assistance by way of freezing/seizing or confiscation of \nassets, prior consultation will be required to determine which system is employed in the \nrequested state in order that requests can be properly formulated.  The EWG also noted that several jurisdictions have adopted - or are in the process of adopting - regimes for civil forfeiture (i.e. without the need to obtain a criminal conviction as a \nprerequisite for final confiscation). The EWG supported the use of civil forfeiture as an \neffective tool for restraint and confiscation. It was, however, recognized that this created new challenges because most current mutual legal assistance regimes are limited only to crime \nand are not yet applicable to civil forfeiture. The EWG has recommended that states ensure that their mutual assistance regimes apply to requests for evidentiary assistance or \nconfiscation order enforcement in civil forfeiture cases.  \n Problems also arise with requests relating to freezing/seizure and confiscation because of insufficient communication about applications for discharges of an order or other legal challenges brought in the requested state. It is cr itically important that the requesting state be \ninformed of any such application in advance so  that it can provide additional evidence or \ninformation that may be of relevance to the proceedings. Once again, the importance of \ncommunication is emphasized. The EWG noted the importance of an equitable sharing of confiscated assets between the requesting and requested state as a means of encouraging cooperation, particularly with states that have very limited resources to execute requests effectively.  9. Reducing impediments to mutual legal assistance brought about by third parties \n \nAccused or other persons may seek to thwart criminal investigations or proceedings by legal actions aimed at delaying or disrupting the mut ual legal assistance process. For example, one \nsuspect sued his own government for damages for defamation when news of its application to \nthe Swiss authorities leaked to the public, and managed to force the government to withdraw \nthe request.   It may well be a matter of fundamental rights to provide an opportunity for third party participation in certain proceedings arising from the execution of a request for mutual legal \nassistance. However, states should ensure that, wherever possible, their legal frameworks do \nnot provide fortuitous opportunities for third parties to delay unduly the provision of assistance or to completely block execution on technical grounds. In addition, the modern trend in taking witness evidence in a requested state is to defer objections based on the law of the requesting state until after the testimony has been transmitted to the requesting state, so that its courts may decide on the validity of the objection. That avoids the possibility of an erroneous ruling in \nthe requested state and allows the requesting state to decide matters pertaining to its own \nlaws. \n \n 129 \n10. Consulting before refusing/postponing/conditioning cooperation to determine, if \nnecessary \n \nWhere a requested state considers that it is unable to execute a request, formal refusal should not be made before consulting with the requesting state to see if the problems can be overcome, or the request modified to enable assistance to be given. For example, where assistance cannot be given because of an ongoing investigation or prosecution in the requested state, it may be possible to agree to the postponement of the execution of the \nrequest until after the domestic proceedings are concluded. In another example, consultation \nmay lead to the modification of a request for search and seizure that could not be fulfilled under the law of a requested state to a request for a production order, that could. Where, however, it is not possible to resolve the issue, reasons should be given for refusal.  \nCost may be another factor. In an age in which law enforcement agencies are under extreme \npressure to deliver services to their own communities, the demands of a particular request for assistance may be such as to impose an unrealistically heavy burden on a requested state. In an ideal situation the burden of meeting requests received more or less balances out that of the requests made.  11. Making use of the most modern mechanisms for providing MLA  \n \nThe EWG noted the opportunities presented by modern technology to expedite the provision of assistance in criminal matters and to maximize the effectiveness of mutual assistance processes. The EWG also noted developments in international forums such as the European \nUnion (Convention on Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters between the Member States of \nthe European Union of 22 May 2000) and the Council of Europe (Convention on Cyber Crime) in relation to the taking of evidence via video-link and the interception of electronic communications.  \nIt has been recommended that states give consideration to acceding to such Conventions \nwhere possible and appropriate, and to developing the ability through their domestic legislation \nor otherwise to facilitate transnational cooperation in the following areas: \n \na)  The taking of evidence via video-link; b)  The exchange of financial intelligence between agencies responsible for collating \nfinancial transactions data; \nc)  The exchange of DNA material to assist in criminal investigation; d)  Interception of communications; and e)  The provision of assistance in computer crime investigations, including: \ni)  Expeditious preservation of electronic data; \nii)  Expeditious disclosure of preserved traffic data; \niii)  Allowing interception where telecommunication gateways are located in the \nterritory of the requested state, but are accessible from the territory of the requesting state; and \niv)  Monitoring electronic comm unications on a \"real-time\" basis . \n. \n \n 130H.

INTRODUCTION \n \nBroadly speaking, assets stolen from national treasuries can be classed as being the proceeds of outright theft, bribes, kickbacks, extortion and protection money, the systematic looting of the State treasury, the illegal selling of national resources, the \ndiversion of loans granted by regional and international lending institutions and the \nembezzlement of project funding contributed by bilateral and multilateral donor agencies.  Because of such occurrences and the astronomical sums that can be involved, repatriation of assets diverted and stolen by  high level public officials and politicians \nthrough corrupt practices has become a pressing issue to many Member States. \nHowever, to date successes in repatriation have been few and far between. so far. Most \ncases take years to conclude and all are extremely expensive. It is rare, too, that more than a small proportion of the illegal funds ar e eventually repatriated to the country from \nwhich they were stolen.   \nB.  PROBLEMS HINDERING REPATRIATION \n The problems hindering repatriation vary depending on the countries involved. Nevertheless, current and past cases seem to share some similarities. For example, the following factors hinder the successful recovery of assets or render it impossible: \n \n1. Lack of legal framework  \n \nRecent examples of recovery efforts show that the existing legal framework fails to \nprovide a sufficiently practicable basis for the recovery of assets diverted through corrupt practices.   \nMultilateral and bilateral mutual legal assistance treaties are too limited in their \nsubstantial and geographical scope and are therefore often not applicable except in the context of the specific cases from which they originated. As a consequence, no standard procedure is applied.   \nRecovery strategies also vary, from civil re covery to criminal recovery and to a mix of \nboth. Each method has its particular advantages and disadvantages, and the final choice depends on which is expected to work best in the local jurisdiction.. Selection of the appropriate strategy a requesting country s hould adopt, therefore, requires specialized \nlegal expertise that can be  costly. The United Nations Convention against Transnational \nOrganized Crime is able to provide responses to some of the problems but, mainly \nbecause of its limited scope, it is applicable only in specific categories of cases.  \n                                            \n62  For a further discussion, see “Recovery of illegal funds”, Tool # 44, UNODC Anti-Corruption Toolkit, \nSecond Edition, February 2004; \nhttp://www.unodc.org:80/pd f/crime/corruption/toolkit/AC_Toolkit_Edition2.pdf  \n \n \n 132 \n2. Legal problems encountered  \n During the initial phase of a recovery effort, the main challenge lies in (a) the tracing of \nthe assets, (b) the identification of the various players involved in the process of the looting and money-laundering of the assets, and (c) the determination of their potential criminal or civil liabilities. Often, t he exchanges of information between various \njurisdictions as well as the public and the private sphere are extremely cumbersome, if \nnot wholly impossible. In such an environment, efforts can fail in the initial phase or not \neven be undertaken because of the difficulties envisaged. The central legal problems are \nrelated to jurisdiction and territoriality. Where legal systems are incompatible, particularly when cases involve cooperation between continental and common law systems, cooperation is intrinsically difficult. Mutual legal assistance treaties (MLAT’s) have often \nproven ineffective when the object is to trace and freeze assets as quickly as a matter of \nurgency. Overcoming jurisdictional problems can slow down investigations, often fatally. \nBy the time investigators get access to documents in one jurisdiction, the funds may have been moved elsewhere.  Legal problems differ significantly depending on the jurisdiction in which the recovery \neffort is pursued (common/continental law) and the approach chosen (civil/ criminal \nrecovery). Civil law, allowing for confiscation and recovery based on the balance of probabilities, has the clear advantage since the evidentiary threshold is typically lower than with criminal actions. Conversely, access  to information as well as investigative \npowers in the civil process is limited and, apart from some common law countries, the freezing of the assets can be difficult.  \n \nCivil recovery, however, also opens alternativ e approaches as far as civil actions against \nthird parties are concerned. For example, in some common law countries (where compensation goes beyond simple economic  damage and where moral and punitive \ndamages are possible), actions against the facilitators of the looting may be available. \nAnother advantage of civil recovery consists in the free choice of the jurisdiction in which \nthe recovery of the proceeds of corruption is pursued. In the case of criminal recovery, prosecution must follow preset jurisdictional conditions while civil recovery can be pursued almost anywhere in the world and -perhaps even more importantly - in several jurisdictions at once. That can be particularly important where there is the risk that the offender might transfer his or her loot to a \"non-freezing-friendly\" jurisdiction. \n \nIs the below also applicable to States seeking civil recovery or only to individuals or juridical persons?   \nArticle 35* \nCompensation for damage \nEach State Party shall take such measures as may be necessary, in accordance with principles \nof its domestic law, to ensure that entities or pe rsons who have suffered damage as a result of an \nact of corruption have the right to initiate legal proceedings against those responsible for that \ndamage in order to obtain compensation. \n \n*UN CONVENTION AGAINST CORRUPTION \n \nThe criminal law approach has its own advantages . Generally it provides investigators \nwith privileged access to information, both at the national and international level. The \n \n 133investigative powers of a prosecutorial office make it easier to overcome bank secrecy \nand to obtain freezing orders. At the same time, however, the final step of securing confiscation and refunding to a victim can prove more complex as most legal systems \nstill require that the illicit origin of the proceeds be established beyond any reasonable \ndoubt. In civil proceedings, the link between the assets and the criminal acts at their origin must be established only on the grounds of the balance of probabilities, also known as “a preponderance of the evidence”.  Another clear advantage of criminal recovery is the cost factor. Criminal recovery \nrequires fewer financial resources on the part of the requesting State since most of the \ninvestigative work is undertaken by law enforcement agencies of the requested country. A clear disadvantage of criminal recovery  arises, however, from reliance on the \nsometimes strict requirements which have to be to be met under the national law of the requested country to obtain the collaboration of its authorities. Courts in requested \ncountries often set preconditions (e.g. that the questing country will file criminal charges \nor will commence forfeiture proceedings against individuals) prior to their agreeing to freeze assets or to keep them frozen. Repatriation in most cases, too, can be granted only after a final decision is made on criminal prosecution or forfeiture to permit repatriation. Those proceedings must comply  with the procedural requirements of due \nprocess of the requested State. The courts may also want to establish that the \nproceedings in the requesting countries satisfy fundamental human rights principles. Many requesting countries have found some or all of these requirements difficult to meet.  Other variations are linked to the particular legal tradition/s of the jurisdictions involved. \nFor example, a clear advantage within many continental law jurisdictions is the \npossibility for the victim to participate in the criminal proceeding as a parte civile (civil \nparty). Such status enables the victim to have access to all the data available to the prosecution and enables the criminal court to  decide on the (civil) compensation due to \nthe victim without his or her having to commence a separate civil action. \n \nIn common law systems, the wide discretionary powers of the prosecution to engage in plea-bargaining has proved to be an effective tool in asset recovery cases. In particular, where the main objective is not so much obtaining a conviction for the each of the many criminal acts involved but to recover the largest amount of assets possible for the benefit of the public, offenders may be offered immunity from prosecution in exchange for their \nfullest collaboration in the location of the diverted assets.  \n The impediments mentioned above, however, touch only upon a few of the more obvious problems involved.  \n \n3. The United Nations Convention against Transnational Organised Crime   \nDue to the TOC Convention being currently under consideration for ratification, the issue of asset recovery as a legal concept will receive some important attention. The Convention, though targeted at combating offences that are transnational in nature and involve organized criminal groups, will provi de some solutions in this context. Once \nratified, the Convention will also be applicable to some other crimes, such as the \nembezzlement of State resources, fraud, theft, extortion and other forms of the abuse of public power for private gain, as most of them will be considered as serious crimes \nunder the national law of the State Parties. \n \n 134 \nThe transnational nature of illegal transfers of stolen property will always be present in repatriation cases. Proving the involvement of an organized criminal group in the activity \nmight, however, be problematic. In view of the wide definition of the organized criminal \ngroup as a \"structured group of three or more persons existing for a period of time and acting in concert with the aim of committing one or more serious crimes or offences established in accordance with this Convention, in order to obtain directly or indirectly a financial or material benefit\", the Convention may be applicable in a wide number of circumstances, and include liability on the part of legal practitioners, bankers and \naccountants. In many cases of the more recent past, the main offenders relied on a \nnetwork of close associates participating in and benefiting from the various criminal acts involved in the looting.  The Convention obliges a State Party to provide mutual legal assistance for  \ninvestigations prosecutions and judicial proceedings in relation to the offences covered \nby the Convention. The requesting Party must, however, have reasonable grounds to suspect that such offences are transnational in nature and involve an organized crime group. In particular, the mutual legal assistance to be afforded may include such measures as the identification, tracing, freezing or seizing and confiscating of the \nproceeds of crime. A request, however, is executed only in accordance with the \ndomestic law of the requested State.   The Convention also obliges State Parties to submit the request for mutual legal assistance in relation to the confiscation of proceeds from offences covered under the Convention to its competent authorities for the purpose of obtaining an order of \nconfiscation and, if it is granted, to give effect to it. In addition, the requesting State is \nalso entitled to submit an order of confiscation issued by a court of its own territory to the requested State for execution.  The new legal framework will mean that Member States handling cases of large-scale \ncorruption will in future operate within a functioning and practical legal framework. In \nparticular, they will be able to obtain the cooperation of other State Parties to identify, trace, freeze or seize assets deriving from a wide variety of corrupt practices.   Recovery of assets, however, can remain problematic. According to Article 14, State Parties are required to give priority consideration to returning the confiscated proceeds \nof crime or property to the requesting State Party. The provision insofar as return is \nconcerned, however, is not mandatory and would only become applicable where a requesting State Party intends to compensate the victims or to return the proceeds to their legitimate owners. While it is relatively easy to obtain repatriation where assets have been directly diverted from State resources, the situation is less clear with regard \nto the proceeds of corruption. In such cases, the interests at stake for the victim State \nare less clear unless it suffers damage directly linked to the payment of the bribe. Where the requesting State cannot show that the funds are actually owned by the State, the requested State may still confiscate the funds as criminal proceeds and keep the funds for themselves, viewing the primary objective as being the stripping of benefits from the criminals involved to show that “crime does not pay”. \n \nWhat about the regime contained in the UN Convention against Corruption – shouldn’t it be reflected here as well?   \n \n 135 \nC.

The purpose of the Project was to create a system of dams and tunnels which would provide water for South Africa, and electricity for Lesotho.  By the terms of the Treaty, various bodies and roles were established for the administration of the project.  The Lesotho Highlands Development Authority (LHDA) \ntook responsibility for matters within Lesotho, the Trans-Caledon Tunnel Authority \n(TCTA) for those in South Africa and a joint body, the Joint Permanent Technical Commission (JPTC).  Masupha Sole was appointed as the Chief Executive of the LHDA, a position of substantial power and influence over the project.   \nIn 1993, a civilian government was elected to power in Lesotho.  The Minister for Water \nand Energy included the Dams within his brief.  He was appraised of concerns  being expressed about the conduct of the Chief Exec utive in the execution of his duties.  \nUnder the Treaty, wide powers had been given to this office, and therefore considerable influence could be wielded by its occupant.  It seemed to many associated with the \nproject that there was cause for concern in the way that Sole was using both his power \nand his influence.  The Minister ordered an audit of two officials, Mochebelele (Chief Delegate for Lesotho on the JPTC)and Sole.  Mochebelele was fully exonerated, but substantial irregularities emerged out of the audit of Sole.  These extended from straightforward red flags, (his housing, cars and travel arrangements) to the possibility that he had manipulated the tendering process for what later transpired to be his own \nends, and there was a suspicion that he had taken bribes.  Sole was dismissed in 1996.  \nHe resisted his dismissal in an audacious way,  considering how events would unfold, by \nchallenging both the dismissal itself and the Minister’s powers to dismiss him.  Both challenges failed.    \nSole was now sued in civil court by the LHDA, who were seeking to retrieve some of the \nmoney they had lost by the mishandling of certain tenders, which had resulted in the financing of the contracts at commercial, higher rates than had originally been available from the South African Development Bank.  LHDA lawyers were searching for money which, it suspected, had  been taken by Sole.  As the documents for trial came into their possession, they came upon evidence that Sole had a Swiss bank account.  Sole \nvigorously and repeatedly denied the existence of any such accounts.  Application was \nmade to the Swiss authorities to divulge the contents of various accounts, belonging to various people who appeared to be involved in the construction of the Dams.  ‘Intermediaries’ emerged, that is people who themselves held Swiss bank accounts, \nthrough whose accounts large sums of money passed, on their way from corporate \naccounts to one of the many which Sole had himself opened in Switzerland.   The Swiss \nmagistrate ruled that the accounts should be divulged, which decision was upheld by the Swiss Federal Court, and the accounts were released.    This was a critical moment.  The Lesotho government found itself in a unique position, with evidence of wholesale bribery.  The civil trial continued, with Sole’s defeat, and an \naward made against him in damages for 8.9 million maloti. Sole appealed, \nunsuccessfully.    \n \n 140In July 1999, The World Bank was appraised of the evidence of corruption which had \nnow come to light, whereupon it instituted its own investigation into the dealings of those implicated in the matter.  An ‘outside’ firm of experts was engaged by the Bank, and a \nhearing took place to consider debarring Acres, after which the  Sanctions Committee \nconcluded that there was insufficient evidence, at that time, to debar Acres from doing business with the Bank.  The Bank indicated that it would re-open its investigation in the light of any new evidence emerging from t he criminal proceedings against Acres.  This \npresent study addresses  the systemic diff erences between a World Bank and a criminal \ninvestigation.   \n \nAlso in July 1999, the Lesotho Government, through its Attorney General, took the decision to mount criminal prosecutions, for the common law offence of bribery, against Sole, the intermediaries through whose accounts the money had passed, and the companies whence the payments originated.  Clearly this was likely to be an \nexceptionally expensive undertaking, but the Government was deeply committed to \nexcising bribery from its administration, and accordingly it turned to the international community for assistance.  A meeting was held in Pretoria in November 1999, at which assistance was promised by a number of the parties who attended.  The group included the major development banks, the European Union, the commercial banks involved in \nfinancing the dams and a number of government representatives.  To date, no financial \nassistance at all has been forthcoming from any of the parties. The World Bank has cooperated by  providing to the Court doc umentation which emerged during the course \nof its investigation.   The Lesotho government had now committed itself to this path of action, and it \nappointed a highly experienced expatriate Irish judge to try matter initially.  The \ngovernment was aware of the huge significance which would be attached to the trials, given their international dimension. It wished to invest in unquestioned efficiency, and to ensure that no opprobrium could attach itself to the process, from the very start.    \nThere were a number of preliminary issues which arose before the trials began. Out of \nthe ten preliminary issues on which the judge was asked to rule, this study examines the rulings on the four most important:   ‘citation’ – whether the company should be named on the indictment \n‘joinder’- who appears on the indictment to be jointly tried with other defendants ‘bribery’ – what are the elements of the offence which have to be proved by the \nprosecution? \n‘jurisdiction’ – should the case be tried in Lesotho or another country?  \nSole’s trial  \nThe effect of the ‘joinder’ ruling had been that the defendants were now to be tried sequentially.  Sole’s trial was the first, beginning in June 2001.  This study examines the \nlaw applicable to the framing of the charge;  it goes on to look at the forensic evidence and how it was obtained.  The study includes a brief account of Sole’s defence, and his silence during his trial, the legal implications of his earlier refusal to produce foreign bank records, and the circumstantial evidence from which the Court was invited to infer his guilt.  This included the representation agreements, which were the contractual routes by \nwhich the money travelled through many different accounts from the companies \nconcerned to Sole’s own accounts.  Sole was found guilty, and his recent appeal against conviction has failed.  His appeal against sentence saw the reduction of his term of imprisonment from 18 years to 15.  \n \n 141 \nAcres’ trial \nAcres is, as far as the writer is aware, the first company to be tried for its complicity in bribing a public official outside its own jurisdiction.  Its trial, beginning in February 2002, \nfollowed that of Sole, and was presided over by Judge Lehohla, a judge of the High Court of Lesotho.  The issues facing the defendant company were complex.  The study considers the implications of corporate liability, and in particular looks at the representation agreement from a corporate per spective.  The representation agreement \nbetween Acres and an intermediary is examined closely, as it formed the basis of the \ntrial judge’s conviction that Acres had indeed bribed Sole, with the agreement amounting \nsimply to an insurance policy against the day when such bribery came to light.  The study touches on the forensic evidence whic h formed a mainstay of the prosecution \ncase, and then examines the judgment in detail, with particular reference to the view which the trial judge formed of much of the evidence given on behalf of the defendant \ncompany.  Acres was found guilty, and fined $3.8m (Canadian).  The fine was \nsuspended, against the day when Acres’ appeal was heard in Lesotho. In the event the appeal was, in essence, unsuccessful, but Acres was acquitted on one of the charges and the fine was reduced.    Assistance  \nWhilst the trials themselves are landm ark cases, unprecedented, amounting to a \ntremendous blow against corruption, being struck by one of the poorest countries in the world, the wider implications associated with them give less cause for satisfaction.  The costs of the trials are undoubtedly punitive for Lesotho.  This study poses questions for other very poor states which are to consider bringing similar prosecutions.   \n \nThe responsibility for cooperation in this process, which resides with the states where many of the implicated corporations and w here consultants are registered or bank, has \nundoubtedly been evaded to a lesser or greater extent by their governments.  That evasion has been characterised by flimsy in vestigations, and a lack of communication \nwhich can only send a discouraging message to others considering travelling the same \npath.    Perhaps the greatest concern emerges from the failure of the international community to make good its commitment to financial support for these prosecutions, which it gave to the Lesotho government in Pretoria in November 1999.  That failure casts a long shadow \nover the will of the international community to unite in support of the eradication of \ninternational bribery and corruption and to uphold the principles now enshrined in the OECD Convention Against Bribery of Foreign Public Officials in International Business Transactions of 1997.   The way forward \nWhilst states are diffident about providing funds directly for prosecuting such trials, the \nstudy suggests alternative ways in which support could be proffered in the future.  FD May 2003  \n \n 142 \nTHE LESOTHO CORRUPTION TRIALS – A CASE STUDY \n \nI. INTRODUCTION  \n \nBackground  \nThe construction of the Katse and Mohale Dams, the Transfer Tunnels in Lesotho, and \ntheir associated projects, has involved the Lesotho Highlands Development Authority (LHDA) in doing business with a  wide range of transnational corporations (TNCs) within the country.  The LHDA is the organisation set up by the terms of the Treaty between \nLesotho and South Africa to run the whole project.  During the course of the mid 1990’s, \nthe behaviour of Masupha Sole, the Chief Executive of the LHDA, caused deep concern. This gave rise to investigations by the Les otho government which ultimately led to the \nrevealing of evidence that a large number  of TNCs had made payments into Swiss bank \naccounts from which payments had then been made to Sole, by ‘intermediaries’.  The \nLesotho government decided to mount prosecutions against Sole, and a number of the \nimplicated companies and intermediaries, for bribery.  A number of major international financial institutions (IFIs) had provided finance for  different parts of the project, including the World Bank , (‘The Bank’) the European Investment Bank (EIB), the South African Development Bank, Banque Nationale de Paris, Credit Lyonnais, Hill Samuel, \nDresdner, and a number of Export Credit Agencies(ECAs).  Some of these bodies, (The \nBank and EIB) have conducted their own investigations or audits into the conduct of the Defendants.  Whilst the EIB has decided not to pursue the matter, The Bank’s investigation is not yet complete, and it has reserved the right to pursue debarment proceedings against two of the TNCs concerned, if it were to find new evidence which had arisen over the course of the criminal trials.  The private finance institutions appear \nnot to have investigated the concerns, and the ECAs to a greater or lesser extent have \nsatisfied themselves that no further investigation is necessary.  The trials, which are now being conducted in the Supreme Court of Lesotho, at Maseru, hold anything from a grim to an inspiring fascination for different sectors of the watching \ninternational community.  \n \n1.2 Prosecuting corruption \n \nCorruption is a particularly perfidious feature of a developing economy, with long-term effects which reach far into the socio-economical structure, in particular where bribery \nhas found its way into major public procurement projects.  Corruption is notoriously hard \nto prove, and therefore as hard to bring to trial, since by its very nature, the trails leading to its detection can be carefully concealed, by a combination of complex banking procedures, flexible use of the law and skilful commercial manoeuvres.  It is interesting to note that, although detailed findings lie outside the scope of this paper, certain \ncompanies have modified their identities in recent years, making their prosecution far \nharder to achieve.  Whilst there is no universal definition of corruption, it is generally accepted to be the payment of money, to a public official, in re turn for the promise of favoured treatment.  \nMuch has been written about the detailed consequential effects of corruption – it is seen \nas morally repugnant, economically disempowering, and it distorts the faith which people expect to repose in their public officials.  When funds, particularly those originating from the public purse, are siphoned off into private bank accounts of public officials, \n \n 143immediately distrust and uncertainty arise, but many other negative and long-term \nconsequences also flow.  One of these is the encouragement of the proposition that some countries are more susceptible to the use of bribery than others, which then works \nto become a self fulfilling prophesy.  Critically, it is the adoption of this self-fulfilling \nprophesy which provides the justification for the kind of criminal conduct which is so often privately offered by a company doi ng business in the developing world.    \nParadoxically, many such countries simply  do not have budgets which will allow for the \nsort of expense which is incurred by mounting prosecutions of such bribery.  \nCorruption shares the platform with bribery – it is the same platform from which one \nplayer will assert that slipping a quiet sum of money into the right pocket, (or concealed bank account) is ‘the way in which business has been done, unwaveringly, the world over, since people began to do business with each other – indeed, it will be always be thus’;  another player will flatly deny liabilit y for corruption arising from the payment of \nhuge incentive-based sums of money into influential pockets (or concealed bank \naccounts);  yet another will profess ignorance of any corrupt consequence which might or might not flow from their compliance with the terms of a contract properly negotiated with an agent in a foreign land, without whose services there he maintains that he could not otherwise have successfully conducted his business.     \n \nSuch views are most frequently expressed by members of the commercial community, \nwhose primary objective is to build up its business.  The norms exist as unwritten conventions, encapsulated in the proposition that the end not only justifies the means –  in some circumstances, it cannot be achieved without the use of such means.  Such views are normally accompanied by the counterwe ight proposition that in any case, it is \nthe way in which business is ‘normally done’ in certain parts of the world.  In other \nwords, there is acknowledged to be a symbiotic quality in the relationship between briber and bribee.    A unique aspect of the trials has been the approach adopted by the Lesotho prosecuting \nauthorities to the symbiotic nature of bribery, in charging the alleged bribers as well as \nthe bribed.  This even-handed approach has been reflected in the judgments of the court of first instance, where both briber and  bribee have been found guilty.    The cases are unique examples of such prosecutions.  They are unique because they provide the first examples of the prosecution of TNCs outside the country of their \nregistration, for bribery in the country, Lesotho, where the effect of their bribery is most \nkeenly felt.  The cases are complex, and raise a wide range of issues:    \n1.3 The real costs of prosecution  \nIn an impecunious country, what are the wider  implications for its government when it \nconsiders bringing a similar set of prosecutions?  A government will carefully assess the \nattendant  risks and benefits which might accompany such actions, in addition to the \nusual considerations it must give to the prospects of success in a complex prosecution for bribery, where the evidence is invariably difficult to gather.  Such risks may be financially or politically obvious and substantial; the benefits may only become tangible as the due process of the law is worked through.  At best, the financial benefits of any \nfine imposed after conviction upon a company  are uncertain.  The Lesotho government \ntook the view it could not afford to allow the country to be observed to tolerate bribery.  \n1.4 Assistance from the OECD   \n \n 144The Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) is a group of 30 \nmember countries, who are committed to the principles of market economy and pluralistic democracy.  Members have bound themselves to work towards the \neradication of bribery and corruption by becoming parties to the OECD Convention \nCombating Bribery of Foreign Public Officials in International Business Transactions of 1997.   (i)   The government of a country where a convicted company is registered may be a \nmember of the OECD. By way of an example, in the first line up of defendants in \nLesotho, nearly all of the corporate defendants were registered in OECD countries.  In \npursuance of its obligations under the OECD Convention 65, such governments may care \nto re-examine, and perhaps modify, their domestic policy in respect of mutual legal \nassistance.  The subtler role played by an OECD government in curbing corruption amongst its own corporate entities  can be perceived by other states and players to be \nanything from unfathomable, through minimalist, to downright obstructive.    \n(ii) The policy of a government concerning corruption will be judged not only by \nreference to the laws it passes under its obligations as a party to this Convention, but also by the degree of meaningful  extra-legal co-operation which it offers to a prosecuting \nauthority in another country and which will form a significant part of the yardstick by which the success of such policy will be judged by the wider community, when assessing the aftermath of a significant battle in the war against corruption.    1.5 Due Diligence considerations   \n‘Due Diligence’ is a widely cast phrase covering the mechanisms which can be used to \ndetect the existence of corruption.    \n(i) The financing of LHWP has been Byzantine in its complexity:   a number of the \nimplicated companies have combined to form different consortia, involving correspondingly different financing arrangements. Banking institutions, in particular international financial institutions (IFIs) may now think it appropriate to re-examine the ‘due diligence’ procedures which they use to examine the probity of their clients, before \nconcluding loan agreements with them.  Where an IFI has, even unwittingly, facilitated  \ncorruption, a real question emerges as to the extent to which that IFI has discharged its fiduciary obligations under its own instruments.    (ii) Recipient countries (those who are borrowing money for  projects) may consider the use of new due diligence mechanisms to protect their interests against corrupt \npractices on the part of those associated with such projects. \n \n1.6 Investigation where corruption is suspected by an IFI.  \nIf an IFI is put on notice, by an audit, by a whistleblower or by some other method, that \nthere is some doubt about the probity of its client’s business methods, and therefore the \nuse of its funds then a series of questions arises: \nWhat marks the limits to its powers of investigation?   What determines such limits?   If those limits leave an investigation flawed or inadequate, should their powers be extended?   \n                                            \n65 For a more detailed examination of the provisions of the Convention and mem ber countries obligations \nthereunder, see p 63 \n \n 145Should they be transparent?  If so, to whom should the information be released, and in \nwhat form? Should the investigative process be disclosed? \nIs the commercial vulnerability of a client, which may be engendered by such an \ninvestigation, a factor which should be considered proportionately, or should the duty of an IFI to investigate, to a forensic standard, now become paramount, together with the power to impose the sort of penalties which will leave no doubt in anyone’s minds about the IFI’s view of the use to which its money has been put, directly or otherwise .      \nFinally, is it time for a company’s probity to be analysed  generally in the same way as its \nfinancial and technical capacity, before loans can properly be made?  The issue which \nhas emerged over the Lesotho cases is – are the procedures which are currently in place sufficiently strict or vigorous?  \n1.7 Corporate liability  \nThe community of trans-national corporations (TNCs) is experiencing considerable \nconcern about the Lesotho trials, and the implications of criminal liability for bribery.  Part of that concern focuses upon the methods by which they do business in countries where, for one reason or another, they use a representative or agent.  The routes taken and the destinations chosen for moneys paid to agents, either under representation agreements \nor otherwise are core subject matter of these cases.  Some TNC’s may now conclude \nthat representation agreements of certain types are dangerously controversial instruments in the prevailing climate of hostility towards  bribery and corruption.  Nevertheless, where the competition for new business involves calls for various kinds of assistance, the use of a highly lucrative incentive based contract with an agent – whereby the agent gets paid only when the contract is awarded to the company \nconcerned –  inevitably admits the possibility that bribery and corruption may be \npotential outcomes.   Another interesting group of questions is:  Does  the principle of corporate liability extend \nacross a consortium of TNCs in a joint venture?  Where the lead partner has created a corrupt relationship with a representative, r equesting if not explicitly, other members of \nthe consortium to contribute to the corrupt payments, (from which the other companies \nmay or will benefit),  does the liability for the bribery extend to include all those who made such contributions?  Therefore is there a corresponding duty on the part of companies joining a consortium to use due diligence procedures of its own to ensure \nthat such payments are not made by or to its partners, under any guise?    \n 1.8 Financial assistance, or the lack thereof  \nDuring the course of researching for this paper, it became quite clear that a commitment \nwas understood to have been given by the international  community to the government of \nLesotho, to provide them with financial assistance for the prosecution of these trials.    The commitment was most publicly made at a meeting held to discuss the matter, in \nPretoria in November in 1999 66.  There, it was revealed that a wide range of payments \nhad been made to Mr Sole which he could not or would not explain or justify.  Those \npayments originated from  contractors/cons ultants working on the project, either as \n                                            \n66 The following banks and organisations attended the m eeting:  World Bank, their lead investigator (a \nlawyer), members of the  Lesotho Government and their legal advisors, representatives of the South African \nGovernment (Dept of Water Affairs and Forestry),  ABN-AMRO, Banque Nationale de Paris, British High \nCommission Lesotho, Credit Lyonnais, Development Ba nk of South Africa, European Investment Bank, \nEuropean Union, Lesotho Highlands Development Au thority, Lesotho Highlands Water Commission, Trans \nCaledon Tunnel Authority.    \n \n 146individual contracting/consulting corporations, or as members of various consortia, a \nlead member of which had created the relationship with the intermediary.   \nAs the prosecutions began to take shape, it became clear at an early stage that every \npossible technical point would be taken by the defendants  and their top flight legal teams, as they considered the gravity of the charges laid against them, and the possible consequences to the corporation, of conviction. The whole undertaking would be fiercely expensive.  After accepting the offers of financial support from a number of parties attending the meeting, including the World Bank and the European Union, the Lesotho \ngovernment commenced the trials.  After a preliminary ruling in the High Court of \nLesotho the trials were separated, the DPP of Lesotho began the process  by trying Mr Sole, then Acres, a Canadian company, and mo st recently Lahmeyer from Germany. \nOthers lie ahead.  \nIt is the clear recollection of a number of people who attended the meeting in Pretoria \nthat undertakings were given there, not just by the World Bank but also by the EU and others at the meeting, to provide financial support for the Lesotho government. Since then, no financial support whatsoever has been forthcoming, from any institution, governmental or financial outside Lesotho. The Lesotho government continues to work \nits way through the prosecutions and now the appeals.  The question which has arisen in \nthe minds of some who have contributed to the research for this paper is  – if the international community as a whole is as determined as it professes itself to be, to fight corruption, then what is the reason for it to stand back and allow Lesotho, one of the world’s poorest countries, to bear the whole of the financial burden of conducting these trials alone, including the cost of providing legal aid for the defendant Sole?   \n \n \n 147 \n2. HISTORY OF THE LESOTHO HIGHLANDS WATER PROJECT.  \n \nThe Treaty \nIn October 1986, the Treaty on the Lesotho Highlands Water Project Between the \nGovernment of the Republic of South Africa and the Government of the Kingdom of Lesotho was signed. The purpose of the Treaty was to set up the machinery which would result in the creation of a system for controlling the flow of the Senqu/Orange River, to provide water to the Republic of South Africa, and electricity for the Kingdom of \nLesotho 67. The multi billion rand project is referred to as The Lesotho Highlands Water \nProject (‘ LHWP ’).   The two countries shared responsibility for the parts of the project \nwithin their borders: two parastatal authorities were created: the Lesotho Highlands \nDevelopment Authority(‘ LHDA ’), and the Trans-Caledon Tunnel Authority (‘TCTA’ ) in \nSouth Africa.  The Joint Permanent Technical Commission (‘JPTC’ ) was also created by \nthe Treaty.  Composed of delegations of three members from each Party to the Treaty, the Commission was given monitoring and advisory powers over the activities of the \nLHDA, as well as the right ‘to subject to management audit all those aspects of the \nmanagement, organisation and accounts of the …Authority relating to the delivery of \nwater to South Africa’ 68.  The terms of the Treaty obliged the LHDA to consult the JPTC \nand obtain its approval for ‘all budgets’, implementation plans for each phase of the \nproject, the design of project works, tender procedures, tender documents, the appointment of consultants and contractors, and the appointment of staff other than the \nChief Executive. 69.   \n \n2.2 Sole’s appointment to the position of Chief Executive Masupha Ephraim Sole was appointed to the position of Chief Executive of the LHDA 70 \nin November 1986.  He had been a ‘public servant’, that is to say employed by the \nLesotho Government, since 1972, reaching the position of Senior Engineer, Water \nAffairs. 71  The new position of Chief Executive was extremely powerful and influential. \n \nIn 1993, a civil government was elected to govern Lesotho.  The Minister for Water and \nEnergy included the LHDA in his brief.  Rumours had begun to circulate that there were irregularities within the LHDA, such as the fiddling of expense accounts.  The Minister therefore decided to conduct an audit into the LHDA, which was performed by Ernst and Young.  That audit showed the existence of administrative irregularities, which resulted in a specific audit of the performances of Sole and Mochebelele, the latter being the \nChief Delegate for Lesotho to the JPTC.  Both men were suspended for the duration of \nthe audit.  Mochebelele’s conduct was found to be satisfactory, and his suspension  was lifted.  However, the audit found all sorts of irregularities in Sole’s dealings.  He had abused the housing scheme, he had charged his personal expenses to LHDA, he had taken his wife overseas at the expense of the LHDA, he had provided jobs for members \nof his family – there was sufficient evidence of these sorts of irregularities to warrant the \nMinister’s decision to order a disciplinary enquiry, at the end of 1994.   \n                                            \n67 see Art 4(1) of the Treaty \n68 see Art 9 \n69 see Art 9(11)  \n70 see Art 9(21)  \n71 This was a crucial issue, whether Mr Sole was acting as a public official when seconded to the LHDA.  \nOne of the elements of the co mmon law offence of bribery is  that the bribee is a public official, or acting in \nhis capacity as such. \n \n 148 Sole applied to the court to challenge the Minister’s powers to hold such an enquiry. He \nargued that, as Chief Executive of the LHDA, an appointment made under the Treaty, the Minister had no power to conduct such an enquiry into his conduct.  Both Sole and \nthe LHDA instructed Senior Counsel, (the most senior advocates) for these proceedings.  \nHowever, the court ruled that the Minister had acted lawfully, when he ordered such an \nenquiry.  At the enquiry, Sole elected to be represented by senior counsel once more, and senior counsel was then instructed to represent the LHDA.  The enquiry continued throughout 1995, and concluded with Sole’s dismissal from LHDA in 1996.  He unsuccessfully challenged his dismissal, and in January 1997 he made an application to \nthe High Court for a judicial review of the Minister’s decision to dismiss him.  This also \nfailed.    \nDuring the course of the disciplinar y enquiry,  some classic ‘red flags’ 72 had showed up, \nindicating that there were serious causes for concern.  Sole was clearly living beyond his \nmeans – this was demonstrated in the classi c ‘red flag’ ways, by his houses, his cars \nand his travelling arrangements.  The Minister now wanted to know, could funds which \nhad been misappropriated by Sole be recovered?  His concerns arose from certain \ncontracts which had been dealt with in such a way that the LHDA had eventually suffered a substantial loss of funds.  In 1990,  a consortium (LHPC)led by Spie Batignolles, a French company, had been designated as the ‘preferred tenderer’ for the construction of the transfer tunnel from Kats e to Muela.  Subsequently, a consortium of \nsubstantially the same companies (MHPC) was awarded contracts for the Muela Power \nStation civil works, (Contract 129A) and the Muela Dam infrastructure and operations \nbuilding, (Contract 129B).  There were alleged irregularities concerning the awards of both of these contracts.    In the tenders for 129A, the lowest tenderer had been a company called Skanska.  \nMHPC’s tender contained a modification which had not been revealed when the tenders \nwere opened, but which had the effect of reducing its tender price.  Contract 129A was awarded to MHPC, with the result that the African Development Bank withdrew from sponsoring the contract, and the LHDA was obliged to finance the work with commercial loans \nIn the negotiations which arose from 129B, MHPC required the escalation clause to be \napplied before, rather than after the deduction of advance payments, which had the effect of increasing the contract price.  The LHDA negotiating committee refused to agree to this, as it would have been unfair on the unsuccessful companies who had tendered on the basis that escalation clause should only be applied after the advance payments had been deducted.  The MHPC responded by going over the heads of the \nnegotiating committee, dealing directly with Sole, who signed the letter of acceptance. \nThe European Commission, the sponsor for the contract, refused to pay the amount by which the contract was now increased, and again the LHDA had to finance that part of the contract elsewhere.  \nDuring the course of the disciplinary enquiry, Sole had refused to reveal his bank \naccounts.  The Minister decided to instigate civil proceedings, for the recovery of money misappropriated, and for damages, arising out of the contract awarded wrongly to the MHPC.    \n                                            \n72 The name given to irregularities which give rise to suspicion of corruption \n \n 1493 CIVIL PROCEEDINGS INSTITUTED FOR THE RECOVERY OF MONEY LOST \nFROM THE LHDA BY SOLE \n Civil proceedings were commenced during late 1996.  During the exchanges of \ndocuments relevant to the trial, a process known as ‘discovery’,  Sole had been requested, by LHDA, to make available for inspection ‘all defendant’s bank account records for the period January 1988 to date’.  Not satisfied with Sole’s response, in August 1996, Senior Counsel for the LHDA then made an application to court to compel Sole to reveal the existence and contents of those statements. In January 1997,  Sole \nfinally revealed his accounts in Maseru, and his credit card accounts.  At a hearing in \nNovember 1996,  Sole, under cross examination by Guido Penzhorn, Senior Counsel for LHDA, was asked whether he had other accounts in South Africa, or overseas.  He replied ‘No’ to both questions.  By the beginning of 1997, in his fourth sworn affidavit,  Sole deposed that he had now provided every document he was able to obtain, that he \ncould obtain no further documents and that he had no others in his possession.   \nSubsequently, an application was made to the Court to subpoena  Sole’s bank manager, \nby which means further bank accounts were revealed.  One of these indicated the existence of an account in a Ladybrand bank. By the same method, the documents containing information on this account were produced in court in April and May 1997.  In \nthe Ladybrand account lay evidence of bank accounts held in the Union Bank of \nSwitzerland, Zurich, and a further unrevealed bank account in Bloemfontein.    In May 1997, Mr Sole swore another affidavit, in which he deposed:    ‘As regards an alleged bank account held by myself at the Union Bank of Switzerland, \nZurich, Switzerland, I wish to place on record that I do not hold any such account at said \nbank, nor have I in the past held any such account at said bank for the period referred to’  In August 1997, the Swiss authorities received an application by the Lesotho government for the disclosure of Sole’s bank accounts.  The application was resisted by \nall the contractors/consultants, working in Lesotho, who also held Swiss bank accounts.  \nThe matter was dealt with expeditiously by the Swiss authorities, and the Swiss magistrate, Mme Cova made closing orders, in September 1998 for the  disclosure of the accounts.  Her decision was appealed, but upheld, in the Federal Court in Lausanne, and in early 1999, the Swiss authorities handed the bank records to the Lesotho ambassador.   \n \nThe Swiss application was crucial to the whole matter.  In making such an application under Swiss law, it is not sufficient simply to indicate that there is a suspicion that money \nnefariously obtained has been placed in a Swiss bank account.  For jurisdiction to be exercised, there has to be an objective and evidential basis for the suspicion which gives \nrise to the application.  In this instance, the connections were drawn between  Sole, the \nChief executive of the LHDA, the intermediaries with whom he was friendly, and the contractors and consultants who were at work on projects in the LHWP.  Huge sums of money were finding their way from the contractors/consultants through to the accounts of Sole, the man who was in a position to award contracts on the project.  These bank accounts were secret, insofar as their existence was repeatedly denied, on oath, and in \ncourt, by Sole himself.  Such a combination  of factors inevitably led to the conclusion \nthat bribery, on a massive scale, had been occurring.  The LHDA then froze payments to the contractors who they suspected were involved in the matter.  The  civil proceedings  \n \n 150concluded in October 1999 with judgment for 8.9 million maloti given in favour of the \nLHDA.  Sole’s  appeal against this judgment was dismissed in April 2001.    CRIMINAL PROCEEDINGS AGAINST SOLE.  Introductory  \nIn July 1999, Sole was charged under Lesotho law with the common law offence of \nbribery; subsequently, those contractors and consultants who had allegedly made payments to him were similarly charged, as were the ‘middle men’, or intermediaries , \nthrough whose control the money had passed en route from the corporations to Sole.   \nJudge Brendan Cullinan was appointed to try the case, together with two associates, which is the custom in South African and Lesotho.  His Lordship is an experienced South African judge, formerly Chief Justice of Lesotho, now retired. He was appointed by the Lesotho Government specifically to try Sole, as the Lesotho authorities anticipated the \ncomplexities of the matters before the court, and they wished to ensure that no \nopprobrium whatsoever could be attached to the process which lay ahead.  As an expatriate judge, His Lordship could not be accused of partisan judgment, and his substantial experience would enable him to clarify the issues to be decided at the earliest possible point in proceedings.  (This did not stop an unsuccessful application on \nthe part of Sole’s legal team to the Court for His Lordship to be recused and his \njudgment vacated, made even after he had delivered his verdict, on the grounds of an \nalleged irregularity in the manner by which he was appointed by the Lesotho authorities to try the case.)     \n4.2 The law in Lesotho. \nThe law in Lesotho generally follows the laws of the Republic of South Africa.  This is a \nhybrid system, originally based upon Roman-Du tch principles, reflecting the legal legacy \nof the Dutch settlement in South Africa.  With British colonisation, these principles were overlaid with British case law, with subsequently enacted laws being based upon British domestic legislation.  Until 1961, when South Africa became a republic, the final Court of \nAppeal had been the Privy Council in the UK.  Whilst there is generally consonance \nbetween the principles contained within the two systems, in the absence of express \nstatute law and where South African law requires construing, the Court will revert to the Roman Dutch principles upon which South African common law is based, construed in the light of subsequent English case law.   It is a characteristic of the remarkable complexity of these cases that so many of the issues which arose to be decided involved \nHis Lordship conducting a comprehensive revi ew of the law derived from its first \nexpressed principles, and moving on through hundreds of years of decided cases.  \n4.3 The start of the proceedings \nIn December 1999, the following companies and individuals appeared, charged with the common law offence of bribery, in the High Court in Maseru, before Acting Judge \nCullinan.    Accused 1. Masupha Ephraim Sole        Chief Executive, LHDA Accused 2. Jacobus Michiel du Plooy    Intermediary \nAccused 3. Highlands Water Venture Consultant Engineering Group \nAccused 4.

Sir Alexander Gibb and Partners Consultant Engineering Group \nAccused 18. Cegelec Consultant Engineering Group Accused 19. Coyne et Bellier Consultant Engineering Group  The indictment contained nineteen counts, the first sixteen being counts of bribery, the \nlatter three being counts of fraud and perjury concerning Sole alone.   \n Seven of the accused did not attend the initial hearing:  UDC (Panama), Electro Power Corporation (Panama), Max Cohen, Asea Brown Bovery Schaltanlagen GmbH Germany, Asea Brown Boveri Generation AG, Sweden, Dumez International and Cegelec.  Cohen, an intermediary, disappeared.  He had used his Panamian companies \nto channel payments to Sole.  \n Subsequently the Crown sought to separate the trials of Sogreah, Spie Batignolles, LHPC, Sir Alexander Gibb and Partners, and Coyne et Bellier.  (Sogreah, Coyne et Bellier and Sir Alexander Gibb and partners had each made earlier and unsuccessful \napplications for the charges to be dismissed on the grounds that they had not been \ncorrectly cited on the indictment).    Separate trials were ordered in respect of Sogreah, Spie, LHPC, Sir Alexander Gibb and partners, and Coyne et Bellier.  Now HWV, a consortium, made an application to the court seeking an order declaring that as it was a partnership, it had been improperly cited.  It argued that each member of \nthe consortium was a separate legal entity, and as such the consortium could not \nproperly be tried as one single defendant.  This application succeeded.    Following the death of Mr Bam in 1999, the Crown withdrew charges against his company, ACPM, although this company cont inued to appear on the indictment where \nthe particulars of the offence related to certain counts of bribery, as did the names of \ncompanies and individuals who had not attended in the first place.    By February 2001, the landscape had altered substantially.  The indictment, still consisting still of 19 counts, in respect of five accused, was examined by Cullinan AJ.  He reviewed the rulings which had been made earlier in response to applications by a \nnumber of the original defendants.  Taking into account the impact which the absence of \ncertain other defendants had had upon proceedings, he now summarised the indictment as follows:  \n \n 152Count 1:  Accused 1 & Accused 2 (involving partners of HWV) \nCount 2:  A1 (involving UDC  Panama, EPC Panama, Max Cohen, Sogreah) Count 3:  A1 (involving UDC  Panama, EPC Panama, Max Cohen, Spie Batignolles) \nCount 4.

A1. \n \nThe five accused who remained charged before Cullinan AJ were now Sole, (A1) du Plooy, (A2),  Margaret Bam, (A11) Lahmeyer International GmbH (A14) and Acres International Ltd (A15).   4.4 Preliminary applications \nSole, du Plooy, Lahmeyer and Acres each made applications to the Court for rulings on \ncertain aspects of the trials: their legal teams had all met on 2\nnd May 2000, and now each \ntook a variety of points, sequentially, which had the effect of extending the proceedings substantially.  Those of greatest significanc e are examined within this study.  In \nsummary, these applications concerned:   \n Citation (Whose name should be on the indictment?). Acres and Lahmeyer took the view that they  should not have been cited as corporations \n– any alleged bribery was something for which the particular authorized representative of the corporate body should be cited as the accused. One wonders which employees of \nthe respective companies would have found their names on the indictment, if this \napplication had succeeded.  Cullinan AJ.  reviewed the case law comprehensively, together with the legislative provisions of both South Africa and Lesotho.  In examining the text books, in the older versions, whilst he found support for the defence’s proposition,  however, at p60 of his judgment he said:   \n \n‘…it seems to me that a practice has grown up in the last 40 – 50 years which I have little doubt that I should now follow.  The learned author Johann Kriegler has this to say of s332 (2) in Hiemstra:  Suid Afrikaanse Strafproses, 5 ED p 875….  According to the literal wording of sub-section (2) the corporate body should not be \nsummoned in its own name but rather a director or servant thereof in his capacity as \nrepresentative of that corporate body……It is however doubtful that this was indeed the intention of the legislature.  In practice this seldom if ever happens and there are no known judgments to this effect since the coming into operation of Act 51 of 1977.  This \n \n 153practice has furthermore the advantages (a) that the name of the case remains constant \nirrespective of the identity of the representative; and (b), what is even more important, that a clear distinction is drawn between the citation of the natural person in terms of \nsub-section (2) qua representative, and his personal citation by reason of sub-section \n(5).  The risk of imperfect citations, as in S v Freeman 73 or irregular substitutions, as in \nR v Erasmus 74 is thereby diminished.’. \n \nWith this point settled in favour of the pros ecution, the companies of  Acres, Lahmeyer \nand Spie therefore remained the named defendants. \n  4.4.2 Joinder (Whose name appears on the indictment, to be jointly tried with other defendants?) \nSole objected to being tried with any of the other accused.  Whilst Du Plooy, one of the \nintermediaries,  did not object to being tried with Sole on Count 1, he did not wish to be tried with him in respect of any of the other charges.  The basis of their applications was simply that the ‘same offence’ for which they were to be tried was literally just that…whereas the Crown argued that the ‘same offence’ meant ‘the same species of \noffence’, which therefore allowed for the use of the term ‘at different times’, ‘any number \nof persons, and in particular ‘may be charged with substantive offences’.   The argument for Sole and Du Plooy was that under common law, in particular the case of  R v \nPeerkhan and Lalloo 75 the same offence means exactly this, and could only be altered \nby express statutory provision.  Senior Counsel for the Prosecution argued that such \nprovision was arguably contained within the Code of Criminal Procedure.    Cullinan AJ reviewed the authorities and textbooks, and concluded as follows; \n \n4.5 ‘The same offence’. \nThe Crown  charged a number of Defendants with the same offence – however, this did \nnot mean the same offence at different times, unless it was a single continuing offence, being committed by different people at different times.   There might be different roles \nplayed in the commission of one offence, at different times: for example where there is \nan offence of theft, there could be the connected offence(s) of receiving.  However, if the ‘same offence’ were to be construed as meaning the ‘same species of offences’, this would open to the door to the possibility of unlimited joinder of unconnected offences. Accordingly, ‘the same offence’ should be given their ordinary and natural meaning. \n                                            \n73 1970(3) SA 700 (N) \n74 1970 (4) SA 378 ( R) \n75 1906 TS 798 \n \n 154 \n4.6  ‘Substantive offences’ \nSubstantive offences, as referred to in the 1917 Code at s 140 refers to the substantive offence of the principal offender, the accessory after the fact or the substantive offence \nof receiving.  Cullinan AJ referred to the dicta of Innes CJ in  R v Mlooi and others 76: \n \n‘The first paragraph provides that any number of persons charged with committing or procuring the same offence ‘or with having after the commission of the offence harboured or assisted the offender’ may be charged with ‘substantive offences’ in the same indictment, although the principal offender is not charged.  And the second paragraph enacts that one who harbours or assists the offender after an offence may be \ncharged in the same indictment with the principal offender.  There the Legislature was \ndealing in terms with the crime of being an accessory after the fact, and the language used goes to show that it was to be dealt with as a substantive offence and not as a crime covered by the main offence’.  \nWhilst Senior Counsel for the Crown argued that a joint trial was a more expeditious way \nof administering justice, His Lordship took the view that this would not be either favourable to, or in the interests of the accused.  Joining the defendants on the indictment was beyond the Court’s jurisdiction, contrary to the provisions of the 1917 Code and would therefore constitute an irregularity.  The Court could not proceed to a trial knowing that there was such an irregularity.   \n \n4.7 Conclusion \nAlthough some of the Defendants consented to be tried with others, Sole and Duplooy \ndid not.  His Lordship concluded with this passage:  quoting from Gardiner and \nLansdown 77, p 292 \n \n‘Where at trial an indictment or charge is held bad for misjoinder, the prosecutor is entitled to elect which of the accused he will, upon that indictment or charge, proceed \nagainst individually, and, as against that one w hom he elects, the indictment or charge \nwill be good’…..  He went on:  ‘The Crown …is free to withdraw rather than amend the present indictment and present \nanother.  The Crown of course is free to proceed solely against the first accused [Sole].  \nThe Crown may not, however, join another or other accused on such an indictment, as such joinder will only be regular in respect of the count or counts in which all accused so \njoined are charged.  Alternatively, therefore, the Crown may elect to proceed jointly against the first accused and another or other accused in respect of a count or counts in \nwhich all the accused so joined are charged.’ \n The effect of this ruling, against irregular joinder, was the separation of all the trials, each defendant being proceeded against individually.  If Sole were to be charged on one count with one company and one intermediary, it w ould lead to a multiplicity of trials, that \nis, Sole would have had to face some 12 trials, which not have been fair.  In passing, \none observes that this may not have been the result sought by the companies concerned.  His Lordship noted that the impact of this ruling, were Sole to be tried alone, \n                                            \n76 1925 AD 131 \n77 ‘South African Criminal Law and Procedure’ \n \n 155would be that the allegations against other defendants would remain, to be tried in their \nabsence.  The companies concerned would suffer the stigma of a lengthy wait for the matters to be resolved, were they not to consent to joint trials, as indeed has proved to \nbe the case.   \n \n4.8 Bribery  (What are the Elements of the Offence Which Have to  be Proved?) \n \nParticulars of the offence  Defence counsel argued that particulars of the offence of bribery as set out were \ninsufficient to found the basis of a conviction. In his ruling, Cullinan AJ once more \ncomprehensively surveyed the common law offence of bribery, beginning at its genesis in the two Placaaten of the States-General of the United Netherlands of 1\nst July 1651 \nand 10th December 1715, forming part of the Roman- Dutch law of South Africa.  The \nterms of the Preamble are cast very wide:  learned authors writing in the second half of \nthe 20th century, to which His Lordship went on to refer, have discussed the nature and \nextent of the offence:  In 1919, the common law definition of bribery was defined in the First Edition of Gardner and Lansdown, South African Criminal Law and Procedure thus: \n \n‘It is a crime at common law for any person to offer or give to an official of the State, or for any such official to receive from any person, any unauthorised consideration in \nrespect of such official doing or abstaining from or having done or abstained from, any act in the exercise of his official functions.’ \n \nIn Hunt and Milton, South African Crim inal Law and Procedure (Common Law Crimes) \nVol II, Revised 2 Ed, this was refined as follows:  \n‘…the trilogy of leading Appellate Division decisions on the subject of bribery – R v \nSacks and Another 1943 AD 413, R v Patel 1944  AD 511 and R v Chorle 1945 AD 487 – were largely determined by the contents of the Placaats.  However, it is submitted that although the Placaats thus form the basis of common-law bribery in our law, they should \non the one hand not be restrictively construed in the fashion of a modern penal statute, \nnor, on the other, regarded as a complete statement on the subject of common-law bribery.  For instance, it is submitted that it  is bribery to solicit official action with a  \npromise of consideration not only to the official or his relatives, (as stated in the Placaats) but to anyone else as well.  And the accused must, (in accordance with the general principles governing all common-law crimes) both act unlawfully and have mens \nrea)’ \n \nIn his ruling, Cullinan AJ refers to the definitions at  p 219, and 227 of Hunt and Milton: \n ‘Bribery (as a briber) consists in unlawfully and intentionally offering to or agreeing with a \nstate official to give any consideration in return for action or inaction by him in an official \ncapacity’   ‘Bribery (as a bribee) is committed by a State official who unlawfully and intentionally agrees to take any consideration in return for action or inaction by him in an official capacity’ \n \n4.8.2 Elements of the offence His Lordship went on to set out the elements of the offence, in a passage which has proved to be critical to the prosecution of thes e trials, for it identifies the roles played by \n \n 156briber and bribee as being similar in all respects.   For the offence to be proved, it is \nessential that the following elements are found to be common to both briber and bribee: unlawfully \nintentionally \na state official  (i) offering or agreeing to give any consideration (ii) agreeing to take any consideration In return for action or inaction by the bribee in an official capacity.  \n4.8.3 The indictment (the document setting out the charges) \nTwo specimen indictments were provided in this ruling, taken from  p231/2 of Hunt & Milton His Lordship went on to analyse the indictment in the case, (a substantial document), by reference to these requirements.  Whilst taking the view that the ‘Summary of \nSubstantial Facts’ did ‘descend to evidence in places’, as did parts of the ‘Preamble to \nthe Charges’, nevertheless the indictment contained the following sufficient clear definitions: Sole’s status was that of a Public Official.   the LHDA was defined as a statutory body.  \nSole was responsible for the execution of the policy of the LHDA, and therefore ‘he was \nin a position to make or influence decisions improperly benefiting contractors’.   certain of the accused were those involved with the LHDA on a contractual basis, and stood to gain from contracts they were awarded,  others were ‘intermediaries’, providing the conduit through which payments were made \nto Sole.   \nthe payments alleged to be bribes were made, it was said, in respect of action or \ninaction by Sole in his official capacity, and intended to influence him in that capacity, or used by intermediaries for this purpose.   the individual charges, which referred to the individual defendants, arose out of acts which were performed wrongfully, intentionally and corruptly, with a common purpose.   \n \n4.8.4 Sole’s duty as a public official   The question was what determined the limits and nature of Sole’s duties as a public official.   Cullinan AJ now refined the elements of the offence further:  he referred to the words of \nMason J, in S v Lavenstein 78 \n‘Duties of officials are of two kinds, imperative or discretionary.  As a rule, bribes are not \noffered in connection with imperative duties of officials, a duty which the law directs an \nofficial specifically, to do, and as to whic h he has no discretion.  The greater number of \ncases are those in which an official has a discretion. If the official has a discretion, what the law requires of an official is to exercise that discretion with sole regard to the public interest.  This is his duty.  That is the act he has to do.  When once he exercises his discretion with regard to the private interests of any individual, he is doing an act in \nconflict with his duty, and that to my mind is the only reasonable interpretation of the \nwords of the statute.  That was the interpretation put upon it in Swemmer’s case 79; \nbecause why do people bribe?  They bribe an official not to exercise his discretion with \nsole regard to the public interest; they bribe in order that he shall exercise his discretion \n                                            \n78 1919 TPD 348 \n79 1917 TPD 455 \n \n 157with regard to their interest, and that is bribing a person with the object of inducing him to \ndo an act in conflict with his duty’  [italics added] \n \nAnd then from Baker J in S v van der Westhuizen 80  \n \n‘it is a crime for an official to accept money in return for doing his duty.  As has been \nsaid, it is immaterial that the solicited action is  in the public interest:  it is contrary to the \npublic interest to secure a public benefit by bribery’ )R v Lavenstein 81 at p353’ \n \nHis Lordship took the view that there was therefore no need for the Crown to allege that any benefit flowed improperly  from the action or inaction by Sole.  Neither was there any \nneed for the inaction or action by Sole to have been taken in his official capacity – an \nofficial capacity would suffice.  It was however, necessary for the Crown to allege that \nthe Defendants action’s had been both unlawful and intentional.  In reviewing other \nprevious indictments, he concluded that   ‘the time honoured formula is ‘unlawfully, intentionally and corruptly’….  \n4.8.5 Shared responsibility for the offence of bribery \n The core of this ruling was His Lordship’s unambiguous view of the nature of the offence:    ‘…the offence of the briber and the bribee are similar in all respects, except that one \noffers or agrees to give and the other agrees to receive.   It is not necessary to prove that \nconsideration changed hands, that e.g. the bribe money was paid and accepted.  As for the briber, the crime is complete  when he makes the offer (or agrees to give \nconsideration) to the bribee (per Gardiner JP in R v Kutboodian 82 at pp192/193).  As for \nthe bribee, his offence is complete when he agrees to take the consideration.  I would \nrespectfully agree with the suggestion by H unt and Milton op.cit. at p 229 that where \nreceipt by the bribee precedes agreement on his part, that nonetheless the offence is \ncommitted at the latter stage, that is, upon his part, upon agreement.’[italics added] \n It was this last sentence upon which much would depend in the trial.  It was not necessary for the Crown to show exactly what it alleged Sole had done or not done.  Consideration did not have to be paid or  accepted, it was enough that agreement \nbetween briber and bribee should be reached.  ‘…it is immaterial (as far as the briber is \nconcerned) that his goal is not achieved……Where the bribee accepts or even solicits a \ncorrupt offer, the bribery is wrapped in a cloak of secrecy, which may or may not ultimately be removed’.     \n Cullinan AJ concluded that it was not necessary for the Crown to plead or prove any \nspecific alleged action or inaction in an official capacity on the part of Sole.  The offence \nwould be complete at the moment when the agreement was reached.  This ruling has a generic relevance to the prosecution of bri bery in jurisdictions where the common law \noffence of bribery forms part of the canon of criminal law:  the offence is unambiguously \n                                            \n80 1974 (4) SA 61 ( C) \n81 1919 TPD 348 \n82 1930 CPD 191 \n \n 158committed by both briber and bribee, and therefore both may be prosecuted for their \nindividual roles in its commission.    4.9 Jurisdiction (Should the Matter be Tried in Lesotho or Another Country?) \nThis was a particularly important preliminary ruling, on an application which was brought \nbecause the evidence against the Defendants was circumstantial rather than direct, gathered in part in other jurisdictions, and from which the prosecution required the Court to draw inferences if it was to secure a conviction.  \nIt was argued by Defence Counsel that the High Court of Lesotho did not have \njurisdiction to try these matters.  Their reasoning ran thus:   the Court had ruled earlier that the offence of bribery is complete when agreement has been reached between the parties, that is for the briber when he makes the offer and for the bribee when he agrees to take the bribe.  Accordingly, the prosecutors could not say where the offence had \nallegedly taken place, as  payments had been made after the offence had allegedly been \ncommitted.  In addition, since the payments had been made outside  the territorial \njurisdiction, (i.e. in Switzerland), then the Court had no jurisdiction to try the matter.  Prosecuting counsel argued that the principle of strict territoriality had now given way to a more flexible approach, in which choice of  jurisdiction will be based upon where the \neffects of the offence are seen to be most harmful.   \n 4.9.1 The location of the offence His Lordship proceeded to decide the matter on the basis that the locations of the offences were unknown.  He observed that ‘as a starting point, the Roman Dutch law as to criminal jurisdiction exhibited a good deal of flexibility , more flexibility indeed than that \nreflected in the early English cases’;  he cited Watermeyer CJ in R v Holm, R v \nPienaar, 83 quoting Carpsovius: ‘  There are three fora competentia  in which an offender \nmay be tried, the forum domicilii , the forum delicti commissi  and forum apprehensionis’ .  \n[Roughly translated, these are the three possible jurisdictions in which an offence may be tried:  where an offender lives, where he is alleged to have committed the offence and where the offence was discovered].    His Lordship continued ‘Ultimately international law saw the development on a universal pattern of a number of underlying \nprinciples determining jurisdiction.  Those principles evolved in step with the case law….’ \n He examined the line of English cases where an offence had been committed partly in one jurisdiction, partly in another, beginning by considering a proposition not dissimilar to that which had been put by Sole’s counsel.    \nIn R v Burdett 84, a case from 1820, Abbott CJ found that the offence, a libel written in \none county for publication in another,  was not an entire crime in either of the counties.  \nHowever, his brother judges did not agree with him, taking the view that the crime was \ntriable in either county. \nIn a later case, R v Keyn 85, the proposition was that where there is a continuing act, the \noffence should be tried in the jurisdiction where the offence takes effect.   \nIn Macleod v Attorney General for New South Wales 86, the defendant was convicted in \nNew South Wales of bigamy under a statute which  provided ‘ whosever  being married \n                                            \n83 1948 1 SALR  925 (A \n84  (1697) 1 Ld Raym. 148 \n85  (1867-77) L.R. 2 Ex. D. 63 \n86  (1867-77) L.R. 2 Ex. D. 63  \n \n 159marries another person during the life of the former husband or wife, wheresoever such \nsecond marriage takes place, shall be liable to penal servitude for seven years.’  Their Lordships on the Privy Council held that there had been no jurisdiction in New South \nWales to try an offence committed in America.  S pecifically, they ruled ‘All crime is local.  \nThe jurisdiction belongs to the country where the crime is committed, and except over her own subjects, Her Majesty and the Imperial Legislature have no power whatever’.  Cullinan AJ pointed out that this had referred to an offence which had been wholly  \ncommitted by a national in a foreign jurisdiction, where the express words of the statute did not extend extra-territorially.   \n \nTurning to the emerging body of international law, His Lordship reviewed the ‘Lotus \ncase 87’, where a French ship, The Lotus, had collided with a Turkish ship, The Boz-\nKourt, on the high seas, resulting in the loss of the Turkish ship and the lives of some its \npassengers and crew.  When The Lotus put in to port in Turkey, the officer of the watch was arrested, tried and convicted of culpable homicide.    The French disputed Turkey’s exercise of its jurisdiction in the Permanent Court of International Justice.  France \nargued, in the Permanent court of International Justice, that only the flag-state had \njurisdiction over acts committed on board a vessel on the high seas, whereas Turkey argued that the effects had been felt on the Turkish ship, which was an extension of Turkish territory.  The court divided 6-6 on the issue, and the President’s casting vote produced the decision that Turkey had not violated international law by trying the Frenchman, since there was no international law preventing the Turks from bringing \nsuch a prosecution.     \n His Lordship examined cases of high treason, conspiracy to defraud, possession of opium on an aeroplane flying between Bahrain and Singapore, and others, as he traced the emerging body of law on the limits of jurisdiction where an offence has been \ncommitted in two jurisdictions.  The landmark case where the issue arose and was finally \nresolved in the House of Lords is Treacy:   4.9.2 Where the offence is committed in two jurisdictions  \nIn 1970, R V Treacy 88 was decided in the House of Lords.  This case concerned an \nappellant who had written and posted a letter in England, to a woman in Germany, \ndemanding money with menaces.  He had been charged under s21 of the Theft Act 1968.  The Court of Appeal had ruled that the offence continued, from the point at which \nthe letter was sent to the point when it was received.  Accordingly, ‘on that view the \nappellants demand was made both in England and Germany, but he would still be triable \nfor the offence in England, although he might also be triable for an offence in Germany’.   In the House of Lords judgment, at pp121-2, Lord Diplock examined the extraterritorial \napplication of the Theft Act, which was not explicit in the statute:    \n‘when Parliament, as in the Theft Act 1968, defined new crimes in words which as a matter of language do not contain any geographical limitation either as to where a person’s punishable conduct took place or, when the definition requires that the conduct shall be followed by specific consequenc es, as to where those consequences took \neffect, what reason have we to suppose that Parliament intended any geographical \nlimitation to be understood?   \n                                            \n87 cite \n88 (1971) AC 537 \n \n \n 160The only relevant reason, now that the technicalities of venue have long since been \nabolished, is to be found in the international rules of comity  which, in the absence of \nexpress provision to the contrary, it is  presumed Parliament did not intend to \nbreak……[italics added] \n The consequences of recognising the jurisdiction of an English court to try persons who do physical acts in England which have harmful consequences abroad as well as persons who do physical acts abroad whic h have harmful consequences in England is \nnot to expose the accused to double jeopardy.  This is avoided by the common law \ndoctrine of ’autrefois acquit’ and ‘autrefois convict’ 89, a doctrine which has always \napplied whether the previous conviction or acquittal based on the same facts was by an \nEnglish court or by a foreign court…..’   \nAddressing the limitation of this ruling, he continued, at pp123/4 ‘for reasons I have stated earlier, the rules of international comity, in my view, do not call for more than that each sovereign State should refrain from punishing persons for their conduct within the territory of another sovereign State, where that conduct has had no \nharmful consequences within the territory of the State which imposes the punishment.’     \n 4.9.3 The continuing offence \nIn R v Baxter 90, a Court of Appeal case where the appellant had made fraudulent \nfootball pools claims, sent by post from Northern Ireland to the promoters in Liverpool , \nSachs LJ addressed the question of the continuing offence: \n ‘It matters not whether on  any particular set of facts the attempt is best described as a \ncontinuing offence (as where a time bomb set to explode at a given hour in this country \nis being sent by rail) or as a series of offences (as where there are series of blows on  a cold chisel to force a door open).  If the time bomb is discovered on the train it matters not whether it is known on which side of some border it was placed there.  At the moment of discovery it can plainly be said of the person who put it there that he is \nattempting to cause an explosion’. \n He went on to say that accordingly, the matter could be tried where the result was intended to occur.    \nThe concept of the continuing offence was revisited in R v Doot 91, a drug  trafficking \ncase where the appellants had conspired either in Belgium or Morocco to import \ncannabis to England, and thereafter export it to Canada and ultimately the USA.  Whilst \nthe Court of Appeal ruled that the conspiracy was complete when the agreement  was \nreached, and therefore quashed that  conviction, the House of Lords ruled that the offence of conspiracy continued as long as the agreement to conspire existed.  Lord \nWilberforce said, at pp 942/3,   \n‘In my opinion, the key to a decision for or against the offence charged, can be found in \nan answer to the question why the common law treats certain actions as crimes.  And one answer must certainly be because actions in questions are a threat to ….society.  Judged by this test, there is every reason for, and none that I can see against the \n                                            \n89 A defendant tried once, and convicte d or acquitted, may not subseq uently be charged for the same \noffence.  See Connelly v DPP [1964] AC at 1254;  see also R V Thomas Sim Beedie [1997] 3 WLR 758  \n90[1974] Crim. L.R. 583  \n91(1973) AC 807  \n \n 161prosecution……It hardly seems in accordance with the rules of international comity that \nour courts should treat the respondents with special leniency because their crimes were more likely to ruin young lives in the United States of America than in this country’. \n \n4.9.4 The attempted offence \nIn DPP v Stonehouse 92, the House of Lords confirmed the jurisdiction of the English \ncourt to try an attempted  offence, in which the acts had been committed abroad but their \nconsequences were intended to have effect in England.  Said Lord Keith of Kinkel:   ‘Thus I consider it to be established that where a state of affairs which the law of England regards as criminal has been brought into existence abroad and continues to \nexist in England, without ever having come to rest, by reason of its effects being \nintentionally felt here, then any person whose act caused that state of affairs has committed an offence under English law and may be tried by the English courts’.  This was a permissive principle, rather than a mandatory rule, however, ruled Gubbay JA in a \nZimbabwean case, S v Mharapara 93, as he confirmed jurisdiction in Zimbabwe of a theft \nin which all the constituent elements occurred in Belgium, with the harmful effects \nintended in Zimbabwe .  \n \nMharapara, in Cullinan AJ’s view, was particularly relevant, since it addressed a set of facts which was arguably parallel to those in this case – the fact that the elements of the offence were not to be seen within the jurisdiction did not mean that the matter could not be tried there; in fact it could, since the harmful effects of the offence were experienced \nwithin the jurisdiction where the trial was held. 94  \n \n4.9.5 ‘International comity’ \nHe reviewed other English and Commonwealth case law, in particular referring to the \nsurvey of the position by La Forest J in Lipman v R 95.   \n \nWhat emerged was the strengthening concept of international comity in deciding whether jurisdiction was appropriate.   \nIn a Privy Council decision in Liangsiriprasert v US Government 96, ( a case in which a \nUS undercover agent set up a deal by which drugs to be imported from Thailand to the \nUS, with payment in Hong Kong – the appellant was appealing the order given to Hong Kong for his extradition), Lord Griffiths said: \n \n’Unfortunately in this century crime has ceased to be largely local in origin and effect.  Crime is now established on an international scale and the common law must face this new reality.  Their Lordships can find nothing in precedent, comity or good sense that should inhibit the common law from regarding as justiciable in England inchoate crimes \ncommitted abroad which are intended to result in the commission of criminal offences in \nEngland.’   \n \n                                            \n92 (1978) AC 55 \n93 1986 (1) SA 556 (ZSC),  \n94 See Appendix 3, where the Appeal Court concurred with this ruling. \n95 1985 21 DLR (4th) 174; 1986 LRC (Crim) 86 \n96  (1991) 1 AC 225 \n \n 162This passage was cited in R v Bow Street Metropolitan Stipendiary Magistrates and \nOthers, ex parte Pinochet Ugarte (Amnesty International and Others Intervening)(No 3) \n97.  In a House of Lords ruling, Lord Goff said: \n \n‘…I consider that the common law of England would, applying the rule laid down in \nLiangsiriprasert v US Government 98, also regard as justiciable in England a conspiracy \nto commit an offence anywhere which was triable here as an extra-territorial offence in \npursuance of an international convention, even although no act was done here in \nfurtherance of the conspiracy.  I do not think that this would be an unreasonable \nextension of the rule.  It seems to me that on grounds of comity, it would make good sense for the rule to be extended in this ways in order to promote the aims of the convention.’  \n4.9.6 Principles of international law \nHis Lordship went on to examine sources of international law.  He quoted Professors \nStarke and  Dugard, from Akehurst 99, setting out the principles which have emerged to \nform the grounds in international law upon which courts may exercise criminal \njurisdiction.  In summary, these principles are The territoriality principle –  where an offence is committed in part in both states, then both states have jurisdiction to prosecute.  This embraces the ‘objective’, where the effect of the crime is felt, and the \n‘subjective’, where the crime was planned. \nThe nationality principle –  where a state may prosecute its nationals for crimes committed anywhere in the world. Historically, this principle has found greater favour with judges outside the UK than within. \nThe protective principle –  \nwhere a state may prosecute acts ‘prejudicial to its security, even when committed by foreigners abroad’. The universality principle –  where some states claim jurisdiction over all crimes.  This can lead to inconsistency with \nnorms of international law, in particular in the absence of a convention, but is viewed as \nbeing ‘less objectionable’ when applied to certain acts which threaten the international community as a whole – such as war crimes, piracy, hijacking and terrorism. \n At p135 of Akehurst, Professor Dugard comments on the Lotus case, where the objective territoriality principle underlaid Turkey’s claim to exercise jurisdiction:  \n \n‘Although the principle of the Lotus Case that a state may exercise jurisdiction over acts occurring abroad in the absence of a prohibitory rule remains unchanged, states have sought to limit the exercise of extraterritorial jurisdiction in criminal matters to cases in which there is a direct and substantial connection between the state exercising \njurisdiction and the matter in question.  Failure to establish such a connection may result \nin an abuse of right’.   The authors go on to distinguish between the constituent parts of the offence and what amount to ‘ mere repercussions ’, the latter  potentially giving rise to impropriety under \ninternational law.  The limits have not been clearly established, although there should be \n                                            \n97 1999 2 All ER 97. HL \n98 (1991) 1 AC 225 \n99 Akehurst’s Modern Introduction to Internatio nal Law. (ed Malanczuk, Peter) Routledge 1997 \n \n 163a ‘direct and substantial connection’ between the state exercising jurisdiction and the \nmatter over which jurisdiction is being exercised.    \nHis Lordship then examined these principles in the light of what is said by the authors of \nGardiner and Lansdown, South African Criminal law and Procedure Vol V.(1982).  In this volume, once more, the authors write that the continuous offence is triable when its impact is felt in another jurisdiction.  They consider the cases of Treacy and Stonehouse, and approve Lord Diplock’s approach in Treacy.    \nCullinan AJ quoted the following passage: \n ‘It is accordingly submitted that there may be circumstances where, in a case reflecting foreign and domestic elements, it becomes irrelevant to ask where the crime was \ncommitted or whether  the last essential act occurred within the territory of the Republic.  \nOur courts may find themselves not compelled to disclaim jurisdiction if satisfied that \neither a substantial element  of the offence or the harmful effect  occurred within the \nRepublic’.[italics added]  4.9.7 Constitutional law in Lesotho \nSole’s lawyers argued that the Constitution of Lesotho, and the High Court Act 1978, as \namended by Act 34 of 1984 limited the Courts jurisdiction to deal with extra-territorial matters.  His Lordship dealt with this shortly, by ruling that where the Act did not specify jurisdiction, then the principles of common law and compliance with international law applied.  They also argued that for the Court to exercise jurisdiction, then the offence must be an offence where committed.  This approach also failed.  His Lordship’s view \nwas: \n‘I cannot see that the foreign justiciability of bribery  (whether involving a foreign national or foreign official) when committed abroad, can affect its justiciability in the State of forum’  \n4.9.8 Harmful consequences \nHis Lordship then examined  the term ‘harmf ul consequences’, as it provided a nexus \nwith the offence which would give the Lesotho High Court jurisdiction to try the offences.  As far as bribery was concerned, he could se e that corrupt payments would if paid, or \ncould, if not paid, fall into that category.  In the sense that there was no contractual quarrel over the work of the contractors/consultants, there was arguably no direct \nfinancial damage to the national economy, but he took the view that the bribing of a \npublic official would constitute harmful consequences to Lesotho.    In an expert opinion provided to the Court at the hearing at which Sole was sentenced, provided by Lala Camerer, (an expert in the analysis of corruption and anti-corruption \ncontrols), the harmful consequences of corruption in general we described under the \nfollowing heads: ‘It affects the economy by undermining growth and development through hindering or deterring foreign or local investment’ It affects the quality and composition of public expenditure projects. It undermines the fiscus through non-optimal collection of taxes and revenues as the \nunofficial underground economy flourishes; \nIt distorts policy and resource allocations, thereby increasing inefficiency It undermines trust and credibility in institutions and procedures It threatens human security through linkages with drugs and organised crime, and \n \n 164Because of the unjust access it facilitates to often limited social and political goods and \nservices, corruption can create social and political unrest if it goes unchecked.  \nHer expert opinion was that such bribery is akin to a cancer within society, leading to \nunproductive public spending, excessive bureaucracy, and the distortion and weakening of the economy.  She added that in her experience the use of bribery creates uncertainty, exacerbates poverty and inequality, and has the cumulative effect of slowing the growth rate of an economy.     \n \n 165 \n4.9.9 Conclusions  \nHis Lordship synthesised the common law with international law, and concluded as \nfollows:  revisiting Lord Diplock’s words on the international comity theory, (the obligation \nof a state to act in cooperation and friendship with other states) in Treacy 100 , he took \nthis view:   \n ‘No doubt these [latter] words may be considered a convenient tag, but they nonetheless seem to me to shift the emphasis: international comity merely permits of  the assumption of jurisdiction, because  of  harmful consequences to the State of forum. In brief, Lord \nDiplock’s dicta constitute in my view an app lication or revitalisation of the ‘effects’ \nprinciple, as an extension to the objective territorial principle’.  He reiterated his \nconcurrence with the judgment of Gubbay J in Mharapara 101, and the requirement of an \nimpact or intended impact of the offence where the offence has been planned and \nexecuted beyond the jurisdiction, observing   ‘It is hard to imagine the impact of a crime upon a territory which is not harmful in effect’.  \nThe test, in his view had to be based upon the place of actual or intended harm.  He was \nentirely satisfied that there was no breach of international comity caused by the trial being conducted in Lesotho.  Neither could it be argued against the boundaries of the application of the universality principle that the consequences of the offence were either incidental or insubstantial, when millions of Maloti/Rand were flowing into Sole’s bank accounts.   \n \nHaving accepted jurisdiction, His Lordship commented there were similarities between conspiracy and bribery, one such being the continuing nature of the offence.  If payments were made outside Lesotho, they we re made with the expectation that Sole \nwould continue to exercise his influence, in an official capacity, in Lesotho, in favour of \nthe contractors/consultants, over a substantial period of time.   \n His comprehensive survey of the jurisdictional question will lend assistance to countries considering a decision to prosecute under their obligations, particularly within those states who are parties to the OECD Convention Combating Bribery of Foreign Public Officials in International Business Transactions.. \n \nThe arguments which ranged over the course of  these preliminary applications will carry \nsignificance in all common law jurisdictions, w here such trials may occur in the future.  \nCitation, the definition of the offence, the jurisdiction within which it may be tried and who should correctly be tried for it were all hurdles which had to be cleared by the \nprosecutors before any of the trials could properly commence.  Each of the points which \nwere taken by the Defendants and responded to by the Prosecution may be taken up in  future prosecutions in common law jurisdictions.  The comprehensive manner in which they were argued by both prosecution and defen ce will be of corresponding interest and \nassistance.  \n                                            \n100 op cit \n101 op cit \n \n 1665 THE TRIAL OF MASUPHA EPHRAIM SOLE.  \n \n5.1 The indictment \nThe trial of Sole finally began on  11th June 2001.  Sole was charged with 16 counts of \nbribery and 2 of fraud.  During the course of his trial, Sole did not give evidence on his own behalf:  this point is addressed fully later in this study; it is mentioned here as a crucial part of the backdrop to the proceedings.    The indictment now alleged that :   \n(i)  Sole was a civil servant, in the employ of the Lesotho Government, and \ntherefore a public official.  Whilst retaining that status, he was seconded to the LHDA as its Chief Executive Officer. HWV, Sogreah, Spie Batignolles, LHPC, ABB Germany, ABB \nSweden, Lahmeyer, Acres, Dumez, Gibb, Cegelec and Coyne were contractors and/or consultants who were contractually involved in the building of the LHWP.   \n \n(ii) the counts of  bribery arose from   payments made by those contractors and cons ultants to Sole, into his Swiss bank \naccounts, either directly or through intermediaries, intended for his benefit in Lesotho,  \nwhich money he then transmitted to Lesotho, either directly or through South Africa. \nContracts negotiated, concluded and executed in Lesotho by the contractors/consultants, from which they would benefit Variation orders and/or contractors claims arising out of those contracts Payments made or to be made, by the LHDA  to those contractors/consultants under \nthose contracts, payments being made, initiated or authorised in Lesotho. \n \n(iii)  on a series of occasions, within certain periods, but on unknown dates, the contractors/consultants offered payments to Sole, in return for him exercising his influence/powers in his official capacity to further their private interests, which payments Sole accepted.   \n \nTo secure a conviction, the Crown had to prove the four elements of the offence: that Sole was acting as a State official that he behaved unlawfully, intentionally and corruptly that he agreed to take consideration (money, in this case) in return for doing or not doing something in his official capacity. \n \n5.2 Was Sole acting as a State official? \nThe question as to whether Sole was acting as a State official’ was a matter of law rather \nthan evidence.  At trial, Sole’s lawyers maintained that he was not a ‘state official’, as he had been ‘seconded’ to the LHDA.  They argued in addition that he was not being paid \npension for the period during which they said he had left the public service to go and \nwork at LHDA.  The meaning of ‘secondment ’ was examined, and whether it amounted \nto a full transfer, but Cullinan AJ took the view that since his contract of employment was resumed,   this indicated that his main contract of employment in the public service was \nsimply suspended, and that he remained a public officer, holding the post of Chief Executive of the LHDA during the course of  his employment, from which he resigned \nwith effect from 22\nnd December 1998.   \n \n5.3 Public or State official – are they different? \n \n 167The question then arose as to whether there was a difference between a public officer \nand a State Official, for the purposes of proving the offences.  Cullinan AJ once more conducted a comprehensive view of the case law.  At p 31 of this judgment, he had this \nto say: \n‘A convenient summary of the authorities relevant to this issue is to be found in \nMilton 102..at pp222/223.  The learned author states the following ‘somewhat negative \npropositions enunciated in the cases’: \nThe bribee need not be a judicial official [S v Benson Aaron 103 at 131] \nThe term ‘state official’ cannot be confined to members of the ‘public service’ as defined \nin the Public Service Act [R v Sacks 104 at 423]. \nA person may be a state official even though his employment is not permanent.  It may \nbe temporary and even terminable at the will of the State [R v Sacks at 426] A ‘person recognised by law as holding an office and [who] has authority by virtue of that office to act on behalf of the Executive Government in a defined matter or manner’ is a ‘state official’ even if he is not remunerated at all or if he is remunerated from some \nsource other than State funds. [R v Muller 105 , Manillal v R 106, S v Makhunga 107].’  \n \nHis Lordship went on to set out the basis upon which Sole was employed, which was \nunder an order pursuant to the Treaty which had led to the establishment of the LHDA.  He looked at the status of the Treaty:  specifically, under Article 7, a power was granted to the Lesotho government, to appoint a Chief Executive, whose responsibility it was, inter alia , to implement the policies of the Board of the LHDA.  The Chief Executive was \nunder an obligation to consult with the JPTC, and to present proposals for the \nimplementation, operation and maintenance of the Lesotho part of the project.  At the \nsame time as the Treaty was signed, (24\nth October 1986),  an Authority Order took \neffect, setting out the powers of the LHDA, and the provision for the appointment of its Chief Executive.    \nThe Board of Directors was modified, by subsequent orders during the following five \nyears, but continued both to include the Chief Executive, and to reflect in its make-up that it was under the control of central Government.    by s25 of the Order, public funds were used to pay the Chief Executive;    \nby s13, the Minister as the agent of the Government would determine the ‘remuneration \nfees and allowances for expenses’ to be  paid to members of the board;   by s30, the Minister had powers to control loans raised by the authority, to submit the annual audit, and supervise or control a number of other areas, such as the acquisition \nof mineral rights, protection of fisheries, assessment of compensation to affected people, \nand so forth. His over-riding power under s59 of the Order contained power to make further regulations, including ‘conferring powers and imposing duties [upon] the Authority…and…generally for carrying into effect the principles and purposes of  [the ] Order’. \n                                            \n102 South African Criminal Law and Procedure Vol II (Common Law Crimes) Revised 2 Ed(1982) Reprint \n1992 \n103 1893 Hertzog 125 \n104 1943 AD 413 \n105 1934 NPD 140 \n106 1944 NPD 332 \n107 1964 (3) SA 513 ( C)  \n \n 168 \nHis Lordship went on to look at the public functions of the LHDA itself. By s24 of the Order, the LHDA is obliged to consult with relevant governmental departments and \nstatutory bodies who would be affected by its operations, both ancillary and related.  He \nalso noted that the Order makes provision for offences and penalties which would protect such functions.  He had heard argument that the LHDA was a parastatal body, with a degree of autonomy, but his view was that this was a particular type of parastatal, which amounted to a Government body, controlled by Government.    \nHe concluded that …’it is difficult to imagine a post of a greater public character than that \nof the Chief Executive.  Clearly the accused was, in effect, employed by the Government, and derived his authority from the public sector.  On consideration of all the above authorities I consider that his employment  would meet the test set in any of those \ncases.  I wish to emphasise, that even were it not the case that the accused was also a \nseconded public officer, I am satisfied that in any event, for the purposes of the common \nlaw offence of bribery, he was a State official at the relevant time’.  5.4 Forensic expert evidence . \nEvidence was called by the Crown to show that Sole had indeed had bank accounts in \nSwitzerland.  A forensic accounting expert and advocate, Jean Roux, (a director of  \nPriceWaterhouseCoopers, Forensic Services (P ty) was called as an expert witness for \nthe Crown.  He had conducted a lengthy and painstaking investigation into Sole’s financial affairs, and uncovered a series of accounts of which Sole had, during the civil proceedings denied the existence. He compiled a ‘Final Report’ on his investigations, in \nwhich he set out what payments had been m ade by whom, to whom, and when.  The \nreport formed the bedrock of the case for the Crown. A legal dispute arose as to whether \nhis opinion on the evidence was admissible.  His Lordship admitted the report as evidence, and dealt with the question of Jean Roux’s opinion in his judgment, in which he said that he had not had to refer to Mr Roux’s expertise, as the schedules of payments were perfectly comprehensible.   Once more having surveyed the authorities \nand textbooks on this point, he referred to the words of Bekker J in Herholt 108, \nconcurring himself with the role which the report played in the proceedings: \n \n‘The report….serves as an ‘ essential, if not obligatory’ purpose, namely ‘to direct the \nattention of the accused, and the Court, to every and any particular book, account, entry \nor figure therein appearing, on which it will seek to rely for a conviction on any particular \ncharge ’.  For my part, the report, and the witness’ evidence thereon serves to place the \nevidence before the Court in manageable form .  Thereafter the aspect of conclusions \nand findings is left to the Court.’   \n \n5.5 ‘Following the money’  \nIn any trial for fraud, corruption or bribery, a conviction will depend upon the \nprosecution’s ability to show where the paym ents were made, to whom and by whom.  In \nthis case, the crucial information, concerning payments by contractors and consultants \nto other parties who then paid Sole, and their own payments to Sole, was revealed in the parts of the Swiss bank accounts which had been produced after the rulings of the Examining Magistrate for the Canton of Zurich.    \n                                            \n108 (1) 1956 (2) SA (W) \n \n 169An application made to the Swiss courts for such information is a complex matter.  The \nprosecution is not permitted to go on a ‘fishing expedition’, trawling through a set of bank accounts in order to find sufficient evidence to enable it to construct its case.  It must \nmake its application with particularity, giving the reasons which it has for suspecting that \nactivities within an account will reveal grounds for bringing a criminal prosecution.  Where the reasons are insufficiently defined, information in the accounts will not be revealed.  It is also important to note that where an account contains many entries and withdrawals of different sums of money, tracing a direct connection between the payments which is sufficient to give rise to the inference of bribery cannot sometimes be \nachieved.   \n A reference to the full transcript of Cullinan’s judgment is appended to this study, and the reader is invited to refer to it for the Judge’s analysis of each of the contractors/consultants’ payments.  In this paper, it suffices to reflect on the manner, the \namount and the secrecy which surrounded the payments, all of which were made into \nSwiss bank accounts.  For example, at p60, Cullinan AJ notes that HWV had supplied LHDA with a list of six European banks for use during their commercial dealings with each other.  None of them were Swiss.    \nThere were relationships of considerable commercial complexity between various \nmembers of consortia.  Contracting and consulting companies joined and reformed different groups. For example, in 1986, Sogr eah had originally been involved in LHWP in  \na joint venture with Gibb, a British company – (‘Gibb-Sogreah HJV’).  It was a partner in Sogreah, Coyne, Gibb (‘SCBG’) which was in turn a partner in the joint venture Lesotho Highlands Consultants (‘LHC’).  It held bank accounts in the name of Sogreah, Coyne et \nBellier.  It was involved in six other contracts, some of which were inter-connected.   \n The payments which were moved were very substantial: for example on 19th April 1991, Cegelec transferred 1,612,000.00 French francs(FFs) from an account with Credit Comm. De France, Paris, to a Universal Development Corporation (‘UDC’) account held \nat UBS, Zurich, an account under the control of Mr Cohen. On the same day, Coyne \ntransferred 11,400.57 FF from an account with Societe Generale SA Paris to the same account.  On 22\nnd April, Sogreah, 103,585.49 FF from its account at Societe Generale \nSA, Grenoble, to the same account.   On 24th April, the UDC account indicated a transfer \nto Sole’s account at UBS, Zurich of the sum of  £20,986.36, which was reflected in Sole’s account by the same transaction number.  His Lordship concluded that, whilst the \nsource of the payment could have been Cegelec alone, the timing of the payment (two \ndays after Sogreah had made its transfer) and the three Consultants/Contractors joint association with LHWP, Cohen and Sole led him to be satisfied that all three had made contributions to the payment made to Sole.  \nIn summary, on the basis of Mr Roux’s unchallenged figures, over a period of nine years, \nvia intermediaries using a series of different Swiss bank accounts, Sole received 8,058.877.00 Maloti, equiv to the same number of South African Rand (SAR).  His Lordship, having summarised the payments relating to each count, at p124, said:  ‘The above schedule serves to further convey the sheer scale of the banking operations \nconducted by the accused.  The accounts maintained by him in Switzerland could not be \ndescribed as normal business, current or cheque accounts where one expects to see a frequency of transactions.  Those accounts were sustained solely by payments by the intermediaries and served as a conduit pipe for such: frequently only a small balance \n \n 170was maintained on such accounts and monies received from the intermediaries were \noften transferred elsewhere within a matter of days, or on the day of receipt, or even beforehand in anticipation of such receipt’. \n \nThe money which Sole received into his Swiss bank accounts was then put to work, in a wide range of other banks:  he invested money in short-term, fiduciary deposits, either  with the bank which received the money, a fo reign branch of that bank, or elsewhere \nwith the assistance of the agency of the Swiss banks – no less than 26 banks, over the period concerned, benefited from his business.  His Lordship calculated, at p128 of his \njudgment that at 31\nst December 1996, Sole’s European assets amounted to over 6 \nmillion SAR.  He added analysis of the investments made in SA by Sole:  at that same point in time, he was satisfied that Sole had transferred probably more, but certainly not less than 430,000.00 Maloti from his Ladybrand account into his account in Maseru.   5.6 The relevance of Sole’s silence during criminal proceedings. \nSole chose not to give evidence at his trial.  In his ruling, Cullinan AJ reviewed the law \nand concluded as follows, at p 203:  ‘I consider however that no adverse infe rence should be drawn from the accused’s \nsilence in the sense that it is an evidential item bolstering the Crown case, and it \ncertainly cannot cure defects in the Crown case.  Such silence is not evidence in the case.  Nonetheless, there may be cases where the strength of the Crown’s case is such, that the result of the accused’s silence is that no reasonable doubt exists in the mind of the Court, and the Crown’s prima facie case  becomes a case beyond reasonable doubt.’ \n \nSole’s silence may have had just such an effect as His Lordship sets out in the last part \nof the above passage.  In any event, it has given rise to great speculation amongst trial observers.  Of course, it remains speculation, in the absence of any other explanation; however, during my research for this work, the disturbing suggestion has been made to me by several people that Sole has been threatened into silence, by others who have \ntheir own nefarious interests to protect.  At the other end of the spectrum is the prospect \nthat his silence has been bought, although this seems generally to be thought a less \ncredible alternative, considering the length of his sentence. 109 \n                                            \n109 See comment on this from Their Lordships in Sole’s appeal ( App3). \n \n 171 \n5.7 Sole’s failure to produce his foreign bank records. \nThis failure on Sole’s part was comprehensive and ongoing.  During the civil proceedings in November 1996, Sole had been cross-examined by Senior Counsel for \nthe LHDA on the subject of such records.  He had been asked whether he had produced all the accounts in his possession, having been ordered to do so in October of the same year.  After some questions and answers concerning the ambit of the October order, Advocate Penzhorn SC put it to him:  \n‘Well, now that I have referred you to the actual order, could you please list to His \nLordship the other accounts that you hold.  You say that you have a call account with?’ ‘Standard Bank in Maseru, savings account with Stanbic, another savings account in Lesotho Bank for the mortgage, the one that goes with the mortgage of the house.’  ‘Yes, anything else?’ \n ‘No, that is all.’ \n ‘Do you have accounts in South Africa?’  ‘No’  ‘Do you have accounts overseas?’  ‘No’. \n \nThereafter, Sole filed four further affidavits,(sworn statements) to which he annexed details of his account with Barclays/Stanbic/Standard Bank, Maseru, omitting the period between 21\nst Dec 1993 and 18th Nov 1998, during which money arrived in the account \nfrom the Ladybrand account.  He added details of his Lesotho Bank account, credit card correspondence, concerning credit card facilities based in SA, and bank statements from \nhis children’s savings accounts. \n In an affidavit dated 30\nth Jan 1997, he stated: \n ’11. In the circumstances I state: that I have furnished the Plaintiff with a copy of every document that I have been able to \nobtain;that (with the exception of the American Express documents) I am unable to \nobtain any further documents; that I do not have in my possession any further documents referred to in the order of the Chief Justice’.  Subpoenas (summons to appear in court) were applied for by the LHDA, issued by the court and served on the relevant bank managers.  This resulted in the emergence of the \nexistence of further bank accounts in the Lesotho Bank, and the account held with \nStandard Bank Lesotho Ltd.  Entries to this account revealed the existence of a Ladybrand account, and in Court again in April and May 1997, Rambobedi J made a specific order requiring the accused to produce ‘all bank records’ for the period 1\nst \nJanuary 1988 to 30th October 1996, in respect of ‘any accounts held by him at the UBS, \nZurich’, and similarly in respect of the Standard Bank account he held in Bloemfontein.  \nSole responded by swearing another affidavit, on 9th May 1997, in which he stated that \nthe Bloemfontein account had been closed for ‘approximately three years if not longer’, but that he was endeavouring to procure the documentation.  However, on the subject of accounts in UBS Zurich, he stated:  \n‘6.1. As regards an alleged bank account held by myself at the Union Bank of \nSwitzerland, Zurich, Switzerland, I wish to place on record that I do not hold any such account at said bank, nor have I in the past held any such account at said bank for the period referred to……’ \n \n 172 \nand referring to his Bloemfontein account,  \n7. I have every intention of abiding by said Court Order, insofar as it may be \nhumanly             possible, and wish to draw this Honourable Court’s attention to the fact that notwithstanding my request for all information relating to the Standard Bank account by not later than 12 noon on Wednesday 7\nth May 1997, I have to date heard nothing \nfrom Standard Bank in Bloemfontein’  \nIn a further affidavit sworn on 10\nth June 1997, in response to the LHDA’s application for \na declaration that Sole held a Swiss bank account, Sole stated:  ‘I do not and have never conducted a banking account with the Union Bank of Switzerland…. \n       I deny that I did not comply with this order ….  I repeat that I have never conducted \na        Swiss banking account. 14 I deny that I have defied Orders of this Court.  I repeat that I do not conduct and have  \n  never conducted a banking account with the Union Bank of Switzerland.’ \n Whilst Sole’s lawyers argued that the record of this part of the previous civil proceedings was irrelevant to the criminal proceedings now under way, His Lordship, at p170, concluded that the statements  were relevant, and could be admitted, simply as evidence that he made such statements.  He went to find, in the face of the evidence \nthat \n ‘he manifestly did hold such accounts, and accordingly I find that he lied, and lied under oath, a number of times, in the High Court.  His statements therefore, while exculpatory in form, have an inculpatory effect:  they inevitably indicate that he wished at all costs to \nconceal those accounts, raising the inference that the accounts were not held and \noperated for a valid purpose, and indeed, in all the circumstances, supporting the inference of corrupt transactions’  And at p175, addressing the argument that Sole’s trial was prejudiced by the inclusion of passages from the civil proceedings:  \n \n‘I cannot see, in the exercise of my residual discretion, that any aspect of unfairness arises or that the prejudicial effect of the evidence of what transpired in the civil proceedings…..outweighs its probative value, and I hold that the said evidence is admissible in these proceedings against the accused’ \n \n5.8 Circumstantial evidence \nIn the criminal trials examined in this paper, (those of Sole and Acres), circumstantial \nevidence was relied on by the Crown to secure  convictions.  Circumstantial evidence is \ndescribed as the body of surrounding evidence from which the Court is invited to infer \nguilt, in the absence of a direct evidential nexus between accused and the alleged crime.   \nSouth African and Lesotho law on this point is based upon the rules set out by \nWatermeyer J in the case of R v Blom 110, with which Cullinan AJ began his analysis: \n                                            \n110 1939 AD 288 \n \n 173  \n‘In reasoning by inference there are two cardinal rules of logic which cannot be ignored: The inference sought to be drawn must be consistent with all the proved facts.  If it is \nnot, the inference cannot be drawn. \nThe proved facts should be such that they exclude every reasonable inference from them save the one sought to be drawn.  If they do not exclude other reasonable inferences, then there must be a doubt whether the inference sought to be drawn is correct.’ The second of those two propositions did not mean, according to Appellate Court \nauthorities, that each fact should be taken individually and subjected to such a test, but \nthat the facts as a whole, or cumulatively, must give rise to an inference of guilt which is beyond reasonable doubt.  It was summed up by His Lordship thus:  \n..’the Court cannot convict an accused unless, on  the proved facts, the inference of guilt \nis, not alone a reasonable inference, but is the only reasonable inference’   The Crown argued that circumstantial evidence in the cases of Sole and Acres was to be found in the use of the intermediary through whose offices payments to Sole were made \nby the consultants/contractors,  \nby the use of representation agreements, which reflected the contractual or allegedly corrupt nature of the relationships between the intermediaries, Sole and the consultants/contractors.    \n5.9 The intermediaries \nHis Lordship examined the roles played by  Cohen, Du Plooy and Bam, each of whom \nwas described, for the purposes of the trial, as an intermediary.  He intended to establish whether or not their activities ‘constituted a link’ between the Consultants/Contractors and Sole. (p179 of his judgment).    Cohen \nCohen had been established in Lesotho by 1984.  He maintained a suite at the Lesotho \nSun hotel.  Cohen had had financial dealings with Sole early on in his employment at the \nLHWP, at the least by assisting him in opening his first Swiss bank account.  The key issue for His Lordship was the evidence, in UDC and EDC bank accounts which reflected payments into those accounts from which, shortly afterwards, sums were paid \nout to Sole.  UDC and EDC had no apparent involvement in the LHWP, and no evidence \nwas adduced of any skills or expertise he brought to the project.  \nDu Plooy \nDu Plooy was seen by His Lordship to have no connection with the LHWP, neither was \nthere any evidence before the court of his occupation or profession.  He dealt, even with \ncorrespondence, through his Swiss bank account, at Nordfinanz Bank Zurich.  His connection with the consultants/contractors was through the ‘Consultancy  Agreement’ which he signed with HWV on 11\nth Oct 1990 at Zurich, giving an address in Zurich for Du \nPlooy, and an address c/o Impregilo, Milan, fo r HWV.  .  A payment of $1m would be \nmade to Du Plooy in his capacity as a consultant ‘only in case of award’ of Contract 123, \n(Construction of Katse Dam and Appurtenances).   The ‘Consultancy Agreement’, also \nknown as a ‘Representation Agreement’ provid ed, amongst other things, that Du Plooy \nhad been appointed ‘in order to obtain, both in the negotiation and execution stages, suitable information and introductions to facilitate the award and the execution of \n \n 174Contract 123.  Invoices supplied during the proceedings by Du Plooy did not tally with \nthe terms of his Agreement, which in any event was subject, in the event of a dispute, to Swiss law.   \n \nBam \nBam had been a civil engineer, and the Chairman of Lesotho Consulting Engineers(Pty) \nLimited,(‘Lescon’).  He was known to be a close friend of Sole.  The addresses he used, as he and his wife opened up accounts in Switzerland were variously in Gabarone, Botswana, and at his consulting firm, Lescon in Maseru, Lesotho. He changed his Swiss \naddress three times.  He received large sums of money into these accounts, with sixty \npercent of the money he received being channelled to Sole, on a regular and frequent basis.  \n6.          REPRESENTATION AGREEMENTS \n  \nGenerally When a corporation seeks to secure new business in a country of which it has no previous knowledge, it may seek out someone with local expertise who agrees to act in its interests, and then draw up a representat ive agreement with them. This is a genre of \nagreement which is widely used in the international commercial community.  Some \ncompanies keep representative relationships  warm against the day when they might \nneed such local expertise.  Payment under su ch agreements is frequently  triggered by \nthe signing of the contract which the representative has been engaged to obtain for the company.  It is a convention attached to such agreements that payments can be made to the representative in any currency, into an account in any country.  It is also a \nconvention that such payments are calculated as a % of the value of the contract.   In \npassing, it is worth noting that if one does not get paid at all  unless the contract is \nawarded to the company one represents, and then only on the signing  of the contract \ndoes a huge sum become payable, it is difficult to avoid the general observation that the \nterms of such an agreement are highly conducive to bribery 111.   \n \nThese contracts are to be seen throughout the two cases which are the subject of this \nstudy.  Cullinan AJ, during his ruling, posed a series of questions as he considered the \nrepresentation agreement as a means by wh ich money was paid to Du Plooy, Bam and \nMrs Bam.   His Lordship posed a number of  key questions about the representation agreement during his judgment   \n1. at p184, he asked of Du Plooy’s arrangement: \n‘What need was there for either party therefore, purportedly associated by the common bond of business in Lesotho, to enter into contractual agreement and conduct financial transactions in a foreign country, far remov ed from the LHWP, if their relationship was \nbona fide ?’   \n \nThis question was posed again in the trial of Acres: part of the argument which has emerged during the course of these trials is that a ‘representative’ is looking for some security for his money, and that he is entit led to have his money paid in whatever \n                                            \n111 For further discussion, see p 44 \n \n \n 175currency he wishes, in whatever bank.  The residual question is why such banks did not \nfeature in the list supplied by HWV to LHDA.    \n2. At p186  \nConcerning Du Plooy he asked, where a consultant only becomes payable with the award of the contract…’How can a consultant give such an undertaking bona fide ?  [to \nsupply necessary information, as well as to undertake to secure a contract].  Surely the \nconsideration which he offers and which he executes is the services which he renders, \nand not the results thereof. [italics added] \n \n3. At p 187 Looking at the evidence of payments made i ndividually to Mr and Mrs Bam, he asked \n‘What …was the purpose, under a representation agreement, of such large payments [as were made] to Mrs Bam on a personal Swiss bank account?’ \n \n4. At p 189 He observed that ‘payments from Acres to  Mr Bam and from Mr Bam to the accused \nwere effected over a period of six years.  If nothing more than a bona fide representation agreement was concerned, where seemingly nothing more technical than the good-will \nof [Sole] was sought, how exactly did Mr Bam obtain and preserve such goodwill?  What \nmethods did he use?  Surely, over a period of six years, the inference of bribery would arise.  5. At p 190 a)  ‘Any representation agreement would presumably have been negotiated with \nAssociated Consultants and Project Managers (ACPM) [A consultancy of which the two \ndirectors were Mr and Mrs Bam.]  Why then was payment made to the personal account of Mr Bam? ‘Why …was any payment made to Mrs Bam?’ ‘Why was resort had to payment to a Swiss bank account?  Why not pay ACPM or \nindeed Lescon locally?’ \n \n6.2 Conclusions \n \n6.2.1 The transactions In the last pages of his judgment, Cullinan AJ surveyed the whole complex financial \npicture which had emerged during Sole’s trial.  He observed that the counts with which \nSole was charged reflected arose from transactions which were ‘inextricably bound together’, by the contemporaneous and complex payments made by the consultants/contractors, to the intermediaries and from those intermediaries to Sole.  At p 191, he took the following view of the relationship between the intermediaries and \nSole: \n ‘The initial opening of [Sole’s] first Swiss bank account, and the transfer thereto by Mr Cohen on behalf of UDC, of the sums of £2,500.00 and $2,500.00 in February 1988, seems to have set the train in motion.  Thereafter the purpose of numerous payments of large amounts of money by three intermediarie s to [Sole] over a period of nine years, \ncan only have had and can only have been understood by [Sole] to have one purpose, \nthat is, a corrupt one…….The payments by the intermediaries were made for a purpose and it follows that they informed [Sole] of su ch purpose.  In brief, [Sole] must then have \nknown of the source (the identity of the Consultant/Contractor) as well as the purpose of \n \n 176each payment, and in particular what was expected of him in return for such payment; \nalternatively a payment might well have been made in respect of consideration already granted by the accused.’.   \n \n6.2.2 The contractors/consultants roles He went on, at p 193, to review the knowledge and intent to be imputed, in his view, to the Consultant/Contractors.  He observed   Mr Cohen could be credited with having started the business of corruption, by opening \nSole’s Swiss account three months before receiving his own payment from Spie \nBatignolles, followed by other French companies, Gibb and the LHPC, a consortium of which the lead partner was Spie Batignolles. Dumez had already made a direct approach to [Sole] before any system had set in.  His Lordship thought it ‘hardly likely that [Sole], over the ensuing seven to eight years, did \nnot do likewise with the other Consultants/Contractors, who were contributing to his \nfinancial welfare’.  He later made the point that the best way for Sole to ensure, particularly where he received a percentage, that he was receiving the correct amount, ‘was surely by communication with the Contractor/Consultant himself’  \nHe looked at the lack of association between Acres, Dumez and Lahmeyer, whose \ninterests had been served by Bam, and found that the likelihood of all eleven Consultants/Contractors being individually or collectively deceived by their individual consultants, over the period concerned, was extremely unlikely.  He viewed the conduct of business via undisclosed Swiss bank accounts, when none of \nthe Consultants/Contractors were based in or operated out of Switzerland as being a \nclear indication that the representation agreements were not conducted bona fide  (in \ngood faith)  6.2.3. Sole’s defence \nIt was suggested on his behalf by his lawyers that he had no power to award contracts, \nvariation orders etc. His Lordship, at p218, took the view that he nevertheless held a position of ‘pervasive powerful influence’.  As an experienced Engineer, and the Chief Executive, his recommendations ‘would carry much weight’.  6.2.4. Sole’s silence  \nHis Lordship’s inclusion of extracts from the civil proceedings within the criminal trial, \ncontaining evidence of  Sole’s repeated mendacity, enabled him to be satisfied that this pointed to the ‘covert nature of the Swiss bank accounts’, for which there was only one reasonable explanation.   He commented that Sole’s silence did not affect his ruling, since he could decide the case without reference to it, and he proceeded to find Sole \nguilty of the eleven counts of bribery of which he stood accused.   \n ‘…I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt, as the only reasonable inference, that in the eleven counts of bribery involved, the accused and the relevant Consultant/Contractor in each count, unlawfully, intentionally and corruptly entered into a corrupt agreement, whereby the accused agreed to further the private interests of that Consultant/Contractor \nin its involvement with the LHWP, pursuant to which agreement the \nConsultant/Contractor paid the accused the particular sum of money which I have previously specified under each count.   \n \n 177Sole was subsequently imprisoned for eighteen years.  His appeal was heard in April \n2003.  [Now see Appendix 3]  7 THE CHARGES AGAINST ACRES \n \nAcres Company has not felt able to discuss the trial with the writer of this case study despite efforts made by the writer to speak with the company and with its legal advisers.  \n7.1 Background \nThe history of Acres’ association with Lesotho began in 1981,when Acres became \ninvolved in the construction of Moshoeshoe Airport, near Maseru.  Between 1981 and 1986, both Acres and Lescon, (Mr Bam’s engineering consultancy)  worked together on the airport project, as part of the Delcanda consortium.  The Lesotho Highlands Development Authority(LHDA) was established during this  period, and by a competitive \nbidding procedure,  Acres was awarded Contract 19  by the LHDA during April 1987, \nunder which it would provide technical assistance  to the LHDA.  This effectively meant the provision of qualified professional staff to the LHDA and in particular, to the technical division, concerning the main construction works.  For example, Mr Jonker, of Acres, acted as assistant to Mr Sole. Mr Witherall, of Acres, took over that position, from \nOctober 1989.  Under the provisions of Contract 64, appointing him to that position, Mr \nWitherall had very wide powers within the LHDA, which allowed him, for example, to deal with contractors and authorise payment of contractors when Sole was not there to do so, (including at one point, payments by LHDA to Acres itself).    In 1989, Acres was advised by Sole that the LHDA would ‘sole-source’ Contract 65 from \nAcres, with financing by the World Bank.  For a fuller examination of the procurement \nprocess, see Appendix 4.  Contract 65 was, similarly, a contract for technical assistance to the LHDA, and the services provided relat ed to the establishment and implementation \nof the construction contract for Katse Dam, the transfer Tunnel and Delivery Tunnels going South.  This contract was signed by Acres in February 1991, in Maseru.  The \nsequence of events leading up to the signing of the contract formed a part of the Crowns \nevidence against Acres, is dealt with below.  \n7.2 The role of  The World Bank in these proceedings. \nIn a meeting of bank officials and members of the Lesotho Government in Maseru in July \n1999, the Bank’s attention was drawn to the whole matter, including the Government’s \nview that corruption had occurred, and that a criminal prosecution of the contractors/ \nconsultants was under consideration.  The WB’s response was a decision to investigate the matter, under the auspices of its Anti-Corruption and Fraud Investigation Unit,(ACFIU) a small department which had been initiated by the Bank’s President, Mr Wolfensohn, in 1996.  The number of allegations, and the ambit of the investigation \nexceeded the capacity of the AFCIU, which after considering a number of firms then \nengaged the services of Arnold and Porter, an American firm of considerable experience in forensic investigation with no conflict of interest in the matter, to conduct an investigation into those companies and consultants against whom there appeared to be evidence of corrupt practices.  The investigative procedure itself is determined by WB, and will not generally result in the publication of evidence gathered during the process.  \nFindings are now provided to member governments, where such findings give rise to the \nconsideration of a criminal prosecution. In OECD countries, or under the US Foreign and Corrupt Practices Act, this is a significant development.  In this particular case, another \n \n 178of its unique features was the inclusion of the WB investigations in the criminal \nproceedings against Acres.    7.3 The World Bank investigation \nIn March 2001 Acres was served with a notice initiating debarment proceedings, \n(debarment being the World Bank’s ultimate sanction).  Five months later,  in August 2001, Acres responded, by denying the suggestion that there were any irregularities in its dealings in Lesotho.  The key note of their denials was that they had no idea that Bam, their representative, had been passing on to Sole money he received under his \nagreement with Acres.  The Bank’s investigation encompassed a review of \ndocumentation, which it requested from all the parties who were the subjects of the investigation.  Acres complied with their requests, over time, having requested and received extensions for compliance.  Acre s employees were not interviewed, although \npersonnel at the LHDA in Lesotho were. By the time Acres had produced all of the \ndocuments the bank had requested “it was too late to start conducting interviews”..   The \ninvestigative procedure does not ultimately ca rry any criminal sanctions.  Whilst the \ninformation contained in the bank statements indicated that money had been passed to the Chief Executive of LHDA, it did not, of itself, amount to proof that Acres had known the final destination of its payments to Bam.   \n \n7.4 The World Bank hearing \nThe Bank replied to Acres response in September 2001, on the merits of their \narguments. It had always contemplated that there would be a hearing. Acres  provided a rejoinder in October 2001, and at the end of that month, a hearing took place.  The form of the hearing did not amount to a” trial.”  Submissions were made by all the parties \nconcerned: Acres, Lahmeyer, Sogreah and Max Cohen, who had been implicated by the \nevidence gleaned from the Swiss Bank accounts.  No witnesses were called, and there was no oral evidence given, although each of the parties were represented by their lawyers. There were separate hearings for each respondent. There is no opportunity in this procedure for the evidence before the Committee to be tested in cross-examination.  \nThe Sanctions Committee of the Bank, with  whom a recommendation to the bank’s \nPresident on debarment rested, deliberated, and in February 2002 wrote to Acres, telling them of the result of their deliberations which were that there was not sufficient evidence supplied to them to debar Acres from receiving future support from the WB.  However, Acres were also informed that this was an interim view, which depended upon the Bank’s examination of any further evidence which might come to light, during the \ncriminal proceedings.   \n The Bank resolved to revisit the matter after Acres’ trial had concluded, and to re-assess its view of the matter in the light of any new evidence which had emerged during the trial itself.  After Acres was found guilty, in November 2002, the Bank returned to review that \nevidence.   Its investigation continues, and it has not yet come to a conclusion. One \nmight surmise that it will not, until the Acres appeal has been adjudicated in August 2003.  Clearly, new evidence emerging from the trial will include that which emerged during the course of examination and cross examination.    Ironically, the trial verdict itself would appear only to have a collateral impact upon the \nBank’s deliberations. The Bank’s investi gative procedure reflects its autonomous \napproach to such matters.  For the same reasons as it finds itself unwilling to pay for litigation, (i.e. because it will not sanctify domes tic litigation in case there is impropriety in \nthe procedure, nor  will it create a precedent for supporting litigation), it will not be bound \n \n 179by the verdict of the Appeal Court in Lesotho.  This could give rise to the following \ninteresting scenario:  Acres might lose its appeal in Lesotho, which will be decided upon legal argument, since no new evidence will be put before the Court of Appeal.  The Bank \ncould still decide that no new evidence em erged during the trial to provide a reason for \nAcres debarment, whereupon Acres could return the next day to do business in Lesotho.  Another unique feature of the trial was the inclusion of the Bank’s willingness to allow its investigations to form part of the body of evidence placed before the court, at the request of the Lesotho prosecutors.    8 THE CRIMINAL TRIAL ITSELF. \n \n8.1 The charges \nAcres trial began in February 2002, presided over by Lehohla J.  The charges against \nthe company were that:  \n \nbetween June 1991 and January 1998, Acres paid 493 061.60 Canadian dollars, into a Swiss bank account belonging to ZM Bam, who then transferred a sum from that account to Sole.  during the same period, 180 825,48 Canadian dollars were paid by Acres into the Swiss \nbank account of Mrs Bam, who then transferred the money indirectly to Sole. \n The Crown alleged that the payments were made with the intention of paying bribe moneys to Sole, and that these Swiss Bank accounts constituted conduits through which such payments could be made at arms length.  The representation agreement was allegedly an insurance policy, against the day when the payments made by Acres to \nSole, through the offices of ACPM and Mr Bam were investigated. \n In their rebuttal, Acres claimed that Mr Bam, through his organisation ACPM, had been properly engaged by them to act as Acres’ representative in Lesotho.  The payments, said the company, were properly made un der the terms of the Representative \nAgreement; further, the company did not know  that payments would be made to Sole \nfrom those accounts by Bam, and certainly did not intend for such payments to be made.    In his judgment in the trial of Sole, Cullinan AJ had earlier identified many of the issues which were to resurface as the Crown prosecuted Acres – the nature of representation agreements, the role of the intermediary, and the law which governs bribery.  Judge \nLehohla was now required to consider these issues in greater depth \n \n8.2 Corporate liability, and citation. \nAt the start of the trial, Acres once more argued that the company should not be tried, for \nan offence which was allegedly committed by an employee, without the knowledge of the \nboard.    Lehohla J ruled, in line with Cullinan AJ’s decision in Sole, that the doctrine of \ncorporate liability remained unchanged, and Acres was correctly cited in its own name.  In his ruling, drawing from ‘South African Criminal Law and Procedure’  Vol 1’ Burchell \nand Hunt, His Lordship took the view that ‘a corporate body can be convicted of virtually any crime requiring mens rea.  ….The fact that what the servant does was expressly \nforbidden by the company makes no difference provided that in doing so, he sought to \nfurther the interests of the company.’   \n \n \n 180During the interviews for this case study, the criminal implications of corporate liability \nhave repeatedly appeared as issues which trouble a TNC, and parts of the legal community. The questions most frequently emerging have been these: \n \nThe doctrine of corporate liability is already vulnerable to criticism outside the commercial community, in a climate where it is  seen by many to be a rather flimsy tool \nwith which to enforce good corporate governance, which legislation in many countries now seeks to strengthen.  If such liability were to be reduced, would such criticism not intensify? \nIf an employee behaves in a way which is directly contrary to company policy, without \nthe knowledge of his employer, is it fair that the employer should then be liable to the fullest extent, which is arguably a criminal conviction , for its employee’s conduct?   \nDoes this liability found an obligation on the part of the employer to police  the conduct of \nits employee?   \nIs this a practical burden, which an employer can and should shoulder effectively?  If the \nanswer to that question were to be no, then what is the alternative?    \n8.3 The evidence at trial \n 8.3.1 Agreed evidence:   \na number of aspects of the evidence in the trial were agreed at the start:   Acres had used LHDA money to pay the Bams. The payments were  made, indeed other payments were admitted by Acres, even if they \nwere not recorded in the Swiss bank records The contents of the Swiss bank records became uncontested evidence. \nThe evidence of other bank accounts held by Sole, Acres, Bam and his wife in both \nLesotho and South Africa was agreed.    8.3.2 Circumstantial evidence:   As in Sole’s trial, the Crown had no evidence of a direct agreement between Acres and \nSole - any conclusion that bribery had occurred could only be drawn on the basis of an \ninference reasonably derived from the whole body of evidence put before the court, according to the common law in this area.   Legal argument ensued, as to whether the inferences should be looked at in their totality, or individually: once again this centred on \nthe correct interpretation of the rationale in the case of R v Blom, 112:  \n‘The inference sought to be drawn must be consistent with all the proved facts.  If it is \nnot, the inference cannot be drawn. The proved facts should be such that they exclude every reasonable inference from \nthem save the one sought to be drawn.  If they do not exclude other reasonable \ninferences, then there must be a doubt whether the inference sought to be drawn is correct.’ Senior Counsel for Acres argued that the inferences which the Crown invited the court to draw were based on conjecture and speculation, not upon facts provided to the Court. \nHis Lordship approached the question thus: \n ‘  Suffice it to say any inference that the Court should draw from the circumstantial evidence must be the only reasonable one in the circumstance and it must be consistent with all proved facts as I understand the rationale in Blom above is’  \n                                            \n112 op cit \n \n 1818.3.3 Oral evidence  \nCommencing for the prosecution was Mr Putsoane, an engineer, who had joined the LHDA in 1985/6 as a road design engineer.  He had gone on to become the senior \nengineer responsible for road infrastructure projects in 1987, thereafter Acting Chief \nExecutive and finally Deputy Chief Executiv e.  During his evidence, he explained the \nprocess leading up to the award of contracts, and set out the ways in which the Chief Executive could and indeed did exert a huge influence over such awards: \n Whether or not there was a requirement for the pre-qualification of tenderers was a \ndecision which would be taken by the Chief Executive.    \nThe evaluation of tenders would be done by the evaluation committee, members of which were appointed by the Chief Executive.  The committee would report to the Chief Executive, who would then decide on what  recommendations would be made to the \nBoard. \nWhere outside specialists were required in the evaluation process, then the financial \nregulations required that such persons would be appointed by the Chief Executive, or be recommended for appointment to the Board by the Chief Executive.  (iv) Tenders for contracts were offered when there was competitive bidding for a contract.  \nIt was a procedure in which a representative could play anything from a supporting role \nto a crucial one.   Sole-sourcing: sole sourcing a contract was, as the words suggest, where a company was           invited to negotiate a contract without competition from others.  If a company did not produce an adequate proposal in response to such an invitation, or its proposal was too \nexpensive, it was excluded from the shortlist of those invited to tender thereafter for that \ncontract.  Mr Putsoane explained that tenders were ranked in order of preference, with the Chief Executive, Sole, generally recommending the highest.  He also had the final decision in \ndetermining which tenderer to recommend.  Negotiations with the successful tenderer \nwere then conducted by a negotiating committee which was appointed by Sole.  The essential parts of the negotiations would then be recorded in the MOU;  this would be signed by Sole, on behalf of the LHDA.  In his evidence, Mr Putsoane testified that Sole exercised power and influence over LHDA  matters extending beyond the boundaries of \nhis role as Chief Executive.  By Article 9 of the Treaty, Sole was obliged to consult the \nJPTC throughout the decision-making process, particularly where such decisions \nconcerned expenditure.  However, he did not do so:  according to testimony given by Mr Molapo, a member of the JPTC at the relevant time, Sole did not consult the JPTC either before sending out a request for proposals, or before concluding the Memorandum of Understanding, or before sending out the letter of intent, or before signing Contract 65, \nin February 1991.  By allowing Acres to mobilise before  the contract was signed, the \nJPTC was faced with a fait accompli.  Sole also dismissed  people from the LHDA who he perceived not to acknowledge his authority.  The Crown argued that it was this oblivious sort of approach which led to Sole’s eventual downfall.    \n8.4 Acres relationship with the LHDA. \nAcres had first worked in Lesotho in the early 1980’s, with Delcanda International, as \npart of a consortium building Moshoeshoe airport.  Acres relationship with the LHDA itself began with Contract 19, a contract for technical assistance, covering a period from 1987- 1990.  A letter was produced at the trial, dated 3\nrd Dec 1987, in which Mr Jonker, \n \n 182the Executive Vice President of Acres offer ed his services as assistant to the LHDA’s \nChief Executive.  The offer was accepted.   Documents at trial showed Acres present at LHDA management meetings.  Mr Putsoane had worked for the LHDA for a number of \nyears in different capacities.  He was in a position to describe the close nature of the \nrelationship between Acres and the LHDA.  He had worked with Acres personnel, who had operated line positions in the engineering divisions of the LHDA.  He is quoted as saying  that ‘Acres persons ….were actually part and parcel of the LHDA.  They acted similar to every other employee of the LHDA’.  The Acres personnel in the LHDA were housed in the same office.  Senior Acres personnel were involved in the LHDA at the \nhighest level, from an early stage.  Mr Jonker was assistant to Sole,  Mr Witherell was \nDesign Engineer, technical manager and then A ssistant Chief Executive, and Mr Brown \nDesign Manager.  The dynamics of these relationships were complex:    There was an obligation to train Basotho engineers so that they could ultimately take \nover the project.  Such engineers were to be trained by Acres, under contracts 19 and \n65.  Basotho engineers in the project were aggrieved by Sole’s special relationship with Acres, which they thought worked to their detriment, when Acres personnel were promoted ahead of Basotho candidates, and when Basotho engineers were not provided with the training to which they were entitled.  This discontent was minuted in meetings, \nthe minutes being produced in evidence. \n Acres was clearly so deeply embedded in the LHDA, working so closely with the Chief Executive that at times the distinctions between whose interests were being served became blurred: the question arose: what ro le was to be played by a representative \nacting in the interests of Acres? What was the demonstrable need for such a \nrepresentative? Although Acres had now been working in Lesotho for eight years, Mr \nPutsoane and others working in the LHDA over the period did not know that Bam was acting in the interests of Acres.  None of the witnesses was aware of any relationship at all between Acres and ACPM, (Bam’s firm).    \nThroughout the documentation in the trial, there was no evidence of an entity called \nACPM.  It was an entity with no address save for at the bank in Switzerland.  No-one had heard of it, and it was not registered in Lesotho.  There was no correspondence in evidence, nor invoices produced on behalf of ACPM to give any indication of its existence.  Lehohla J criticised Acres for failing to exercise due diligence as it established its relationship with ACPM or Mr Bam.  In the case of Mr Bam, an exercise in \ndue diligence would inevitably have revealed that in the first place, so far from being able \nto represent the interests of Acres exclusively, (as required by Contract 65), Bam was already on the pay roll of other consultants and contractors on the Water Project, such as Dumez, Lahmeyer.  The secrecy with which these arrangements were surrounded gave rise to a suspicion in the mind of His Lordship, expressed later in his judgment at \np65: \n ‘I accordingly accept the submission that it seems the arrangement with Z M Bam was not intended to bear any exposure to the light of  any type.  This conclusion rightly follows \nbecause there is not even a document copied to Z M Bam.  I further accept the soundness of the argument which is in sequel that the fact that Masupha Sole knew can \nhardly, in the circumstances, be imputed to the LHDA.  Clearly the work that he did or \nthe tasks that he had to perform are thereby consigned to the category of clandestine ones. \n \n 183It follows then that if the relationship was not generally know it would fittingly belong to \nthe ‘red flag’ category.  It requires not a quantum leap but hardly half a step to conclude likewise with regard to the sums involved, Z M Bam was paid huge amounts of money \nfor not doing any of the things stipulated in the contract, and for that matter while he was \nsitting in Botswana’.  \n8.5 The  Representation Agreement between Bam and Acres   \nThis agreement clearly contained ‘red flags’: this term is commonly used to describe \nfeatures of business conduct which give rise to a suspicion that corruption may be \nconcealed beneath the surface.  In such an agreement,  terms may constitute ‘red flags’ \nas much by their absence as by their presence.  In an article in ‘Fighting Bribery: a \nCorporate Practices Manual’ 113 Michael Davies, Q.C, Chairman, Committee on \nCorruption and Bribery, of the Canadian Council for International Business sets out a \nhelpful and comprehensive list of potential red flags which could emerge during the  exercise of due diligence by a corporation in  evaluating a potential representative, where \nthe candidate: \n \ndoes not reside in the same country where the customer or the project is located. does not have any significant business presence within the country represents other companies with a questionable reputation requests that commissions be paid into a third country or to a numbered bank account or to some other person requires payment of the \ncommission, or a significant portion thereof in advance of, or immediately upon, award \nby the customer of the contract to the company claims that he can help secure the \ncontract because he knows all the right people has a family or other relationship that could improperly influence the customer’s decision; or  arrives on the scene just before the contract is about to be awarded.   \nA more detailed analysis of the evidence of corruption within a representation agreement \ncan be drawn from the body of case law in the Arbitration Tribunal of the International Chamber of Commerce, (ICC) where dis putes over many such agreements are \nadjudicated.  Such agreements will customarily contain a term which indicates which jurisdiction will apply in the event of a contractual dispute.  In the agreement between \nACPM (Bam) and Acres, the law of Ontario was selected for that purpose.   \n In arbitration proceedings, to adjudicate a dispute between the parties to an agreement as in the trial of Acres, direct evidence of corruption is not generally forthcoming;  the forensic powers of criminal investigation are not available to the tribunal either, and therefore it is, as in the Acres case, only circumstantial evidence which is available from \nwhich to draw inferences.  Such evidence may be found concealed within either the \nvague or the very detailed terms of the contract, but it is the real intent of the parties, evinced by their conduct, which indicates the true nature of the contract which was agreed between them.  It was this methodology which Lehohla J used to conclude as he did, that the agreement between Acres and Bam concealed bribery.    \n \nDisproportionately high fees will give rise to the suspicion of corruption:  it was agreed that Bam was paid very highly, although Acres maintained that the fee was not out of line with other similar remunerative packages.  The argument for a corporation runs that the fee is what can be negotiated, according to what the services of the agent/representative are actually worth.  This may include benefits other than those \n                                            \n113 Published by the ICC Standing Committee on Extortion and Bribery, May 1999 \n \n 184immediately set out within the body of the Representation Agreement, such as the \nmaintenance of the presence of the corporation in the country concerned, the long term value to the corporation of the project, cross-subsidies where a government is involved, \nprestige, or the use of novel technology.  Such secondary benefits from Bam’s \nrepresentation were not adduced in evidence by Acres, however.  The absence of transparency on the part of the agent’s company or consultancy will tend to found a suspicion of corruption.  Whilst there may be arguable reasons for such lack of transparency, (such as commercial confidentiality) ,where there is a dearth of \ninformation without any such justification (such as tax optimisation, circumvention of \nlaws prohibiting agents or fear of envy) an inference of corruption may easily be drawn.  The nature of the relationship between the representative and the public official may give rise to an inference of corruption. This is a problematic question.  In a small community, \nsuch as Lesotho, when Bam and Sole already had a commercial  and social relationship \narising from the employment of Bam’s c onsultant engineering company, Lescon, in the \nLHWP,  it would be harder to distinguish between the personal and professional parts of their friendship.  The fact that they were clearly close to each other did not appear to have given rise to further investigation by the companies who used Bam as their \nrepresentative.  It was therefore at least possible that an inference might be drawn from \ntheir failure to investigate.  The nature of services to be performed by the agent may give rise to an inference, in particular where there is confusion about the nature of those services.  During its trial, it does not appear to have been clearly explained by Acres exactly what services Bam \nperformed for them under the terms of the agreement between them other than those \nset out in Schedule 1 to the Representation Agreement.  No contemporaneous records were produced, in the form of assessments, instructions or invoices, and the terms of the agreement itself were indeterminate on the question of the more subtle role Acres claimed Bam to have performed for them.   \n \nRemuneration into a bank account outside the jurisdiction of the agent, whilst not necessarily being evidence of corruption, must begin to look like it, when the bank accounts are cloaked in secrecy.  In Acres’ trial, the company had appeared to flout the Lesotho exchange control regulations, but it maintained that it was not itself subject to such laws, and indeed had not been charged with offences under those regulations.  It \nwas the company’s case that it was legal an d customary to pay its representatives in \nwhatever currency, into whichever bank was selected by the person concerned.  In taking this view, the company appeared to be either naïve or indifferent to the consequences of a breach of the regulations governing the conduct of those domiciled in \nLesotho. 114 \n \n8.6 Arguments about the representation agreement between Acres and Bam \nNothing in the Acres trial was more contentious than the competing values attached to \nthis agreement by the prosecution and defence.  The earlier agreement for Contract 19 was not produced in evidence by Acres.  It was the agreement concerning Contract 65 upon which argument centred.  \n                                            \n114 For further reading, see ‘Circumstantial Evidence in  Corruption Cases before International Arbitral \nTribunals’, by Matthias Scherer [2002] Int. A.L.R \n \n 185At the end of 1988, Bam went to work at the Botswana Housing Corporation in \nBotswana, remaining there until Feb 1991.  During this period, the representation agreement was negotiated between him and Acres, concerning Contract 65. Drafts \npassed between Acres and Bam.  The agreement was finally signed between Acres and \nan organisation of Mr Bam’s, called ACPM, of which the two Directors were Mr and Mrs Bam, in November 1990. Mr Bam’s name does not appear on the agreement, neither does his wife’s.   No evidence was adduced of the work which ACPM otherwise did.  Payments under the agreement were to be made by Acres into the bank accounts which Mr and Mrs Bam held in Switzerland.  ACPM had a Swiss address, care of the bank in \nSwitzerland..  \n The services which Bam was to provide were appended to the Agreement, at Schedule 1.   ACPM’s obligations were to:   \n \n- Keep Acres informed of all developments with respect to the services. - Keep Acres informed of general conditions and developments in Lesotho which \ncould affect Acres interest in undertaking the services of which could adversely affect Acres ability to complete the services in a fully effective manner.   \n- Make Acres known to and assist if necessary in registering Acres with appropriate \nagencies and staff \n- When requested by Acres, collect appropriate documents and information for \nforwarding to Acres. \n- Promote Acres interest in Lesotho by presenting brochures and other publicity \nmaterial to appropriate officials \n- Assist Acres in seeking, negotiating and securing a contract or contracts in Lesotho \nfor the performance of the services. \n- Assist Acres in the conduct of business, financial and other affairs of Acres in \nLesotho so as to meet the legal requirements of the Government of Lesotho and properly and lawfully to minimize taxes and other public impositions to be met by \nAcres \n- Provide to Acres support facilities in regard to office, secretarial, accounting, \nbanking, telecommunication and other such matters as mutually agreed from time to time. \n- Assist Acres maintain good relationships with LHDA and assist in expediting \npayments due to Acres in accordance with its Agreements with LHDA. \n \nIssues arising out of these obligations lay at the heart of the trial.  They should be seen in the light of the chronology of events, which is set out below.  Chronology: \nEnd           1988  Bam left Lesotho to work in Botswana \n28\nth April  1989  Sole informs Acres that LHDA would sole-source from Acres for \nContract 65. 19\nth May   1990   Memorandum of Understanding signed, re Contract 65. \n24th July    1990  Letter of intent, sent by Sole to Acres \n14th Aug    1990   Undertaking to pay, by Sole to Acres \nSep           1990   Acres claimed an advance payment under unsigned contract  \n23rd Nov    1990   Acres signed RA with ACPM \n28th Nov   1990    Witherell, (Acres employee on contract with LHDA) authorises  \npayment to Acres for services rendered under Contract 65. \n \n 18629th Nov   1990    250,000. maloti paid to Acres by LHDA \n4th Jan       1991   1.16million Canadian Dollars by LHDA \n28th Jan   1990   Acres paid Z.M.Bam Canadian Dollars 180,000.00 \n21st Feb    1991   Sole signed  Contract 65.  \n13rh Mar  1991   World Bank approval of Contract 65.  It was the Crown’s case that The services to be performed by Mr Bam, as set out in Schedule 1 to the Representation Agreement were already being  performed for Acres:  support facilities, secretarial \nservices, accounting, banking and telecommunications facilities, all these had already \nbeen put in place under Contract 19.     Payments to Acres were already being processed by Mr Lightfoot, who also dealt with Acres bank business and records.   Peat Marwick dealt with the Registrar of Companies.  In any event, Mr Witherall, acting as assistant to Mr Sole, would have been able to deal \nwith anything which arose during the normal course of business.   \nThere was no evidence to indicate that Mr Bam had assisted in the negotiation of Contract 65.  There were no invoices setting out the work which had been done by Bam, and for which he was being paid. What remained of the terms of Bam’s services to be rendered under the agreement was \nto make the company known in appropriate quarters, and to promote it generally. The \nCrown’s case was that Acres was already at the heart of the LHDA, so introduction and promotion were no longer relevant. Bam was already engaged with LHDA through his own company, Lescon, under Contract 45.  Therefore there was a fundamental conflict of interest which precluded Bam from acting as an agent for a contractor/consultant. \n \nIt was Acres case that  1. In the occasionally fraught political climate of Lesotho, they needed a suitably \nqualified representative to protect their interests, and to promote Acres in Lesotho:   \n2. The payments  made to Mr Bam were legal, indeed they were reflected in the \ncompany’s accounts.  What Mr Bam might do with the money thereafter was a matter for him \n3. The services they required of him coul d be performed over the telephone from \nBotswana. \n4. He was an engineer, with exactly the kind of qualifications they needed, with \nyears of experience in this area, and a knowledge and experience of Lesotho \nfrom which they would derive substantial benefit. In any event, his expertise was required in the administration of the contract rather than achieving its award, with particular reference to the volatile political situation in Lesotho at the time.   \n \nAcres had put the following proposition  to the World Bank during its debarment proceedings, which formed part of the body of evidence before the court in this case.  ‘Post award of both contracts, Bam’s role fell  principally into two areas :  (1) political \nintelligence, and (2) intelligence concerning Acres personnel performance’  This, they said, explained the absence of documentation concerning the Representation \nAgreement.  Lehohla J found an inconsistency between this scarcity and the  profusion \nof references provided by Defence witnesses to invoices found in the documentation underlying money transfers to Bam’s account in Geneva.  Additionally, he found that the \n \n 187evidence provided to the Court indicated that in fact Acres staff performed functions \nconnected with the security situation and political events.  \nThe Court considered how Mr Bam could have performed those particular functions \nhimself, from Botswana, where he was in full time employment during the relevant period leading up to the signing of Contract 65.   At p50 of his judgment, His Lordship said:   ‘On the face of it Z M Bam who also performs the same functions on behalf of Acres would seem to be serving in this regard as nothing else but a fifth wheel to the cart’. \n   \nThe  Crown invited the Court to conclude that the representative agreement was in fact a \nsham, put in place to conceal acts of bribery.    \n8.7 The signing of Contract 65. \nThe significance of the sequence  of events leading up to the signing of Contract 65 was \ndrawn to the Court’s attention by the prosecution.  By the 23\nrd of November, 1990,  the \ndate on which the Agreement between ACPM and Acres was signed, Acres had already begun work, but not yet been paid. At p128 of  R V Acres, Lehohla J observed that Mr Hare, for Acres, agreed that Acres had started work under Contract 65, but was not as yet getting paid for doing it, neither was there a contract in place.  The consequences of \nthis state of affairs for Acres could have been dire.   By 25\nth September 1990, the Acres \nmark up, a crucial term of the contract, had still not been agreed.  The company badly needed an advance payment, and a signed contract. By 23\nrd November, all but two \nminor terms of Contract 65 had been agreed.   On the 28th November, Acres own \nemployee, Mr Witherell, authorised advanc e payments to Acres on the part of Sole, \nwhich were made on the 29th.  \n \nAt p 98 of his judgment,  Lehohla J examined the role ACPM was supposed to play in getting Contract 65.   ‘In terms of this agreement ACPM was to assist Acres in getting contract 65 and also perform certain services during the life time of the contract.  For this Z M Bam would \nreceive 3.6% of the net value of the contract with Acres.  Bearing in mind Acres’ mark up \nof 14. 7% this meant that he would get approximately 25% of Acres profit.  The question that immediately arises is why pay him 25% occasioned by the mark up in circumstances where contract 65 is in the bag’.  At p100, His Lordship addressed the extra-territorial nature of the RA, citing Cullinan AJ \nin R v Sole \n ‘What need was there for either party therefore, purportedly associated by the common bond of business in Lesotho, to enter into contractual agreement and conduct financial transactions in a foreign country, far remov ed from the LHWP, if their relationship was \nbona fide’. \n It is interesting to note that the whereas the RA was signed by ACPM, the bank accounts into which the moneys were paid were opened in the names of Mr and Mrs Bam, which would appear to have presented Acres with some difficulty had there been some contractual dispute between the  parties at a later stage. \n \n8.8 ‘Following the money.’ \nTracing the transfer of moneys from consultants/contractors to the Bam accounts in \nGeneva, Mr Roux, the forensic expert, adopted the approach that if a transfer was made \n \n 188by the consultant/contractor, and a payment out  of the account made to Sole’s account \nwithin a sufficiently short period of time, or where there was no other transaction in that specific account for a specific period,  then it could be assumed that the money was \nused to pay Sole.   The pattern of payments revealed that as a general rule, 60% of the \nmoney paid to Bam was passed on to Sole within a very short period of time after he had received it from Acres.  By the agreement, Bam was to be paid 4 x Canadian $180,000.00 followed by 69 consecutive monthly sums of  Canadian $7,826.  By comparison with the earnings of others involved in the LHDA, including the salary of Sole himself, these were very substantial sums.   \n \nAt p 89 of his judgment, Lehohla J took the view that …’It simply defies intelligence that Acres would have paid Z M Bam these huge monthly amounts, over and above the Canadian $180,000.00 for ‘intelligence’.  In fact, even if Z M Bam was in Lesotho working honestly on a full time basis in respect of the representative agreement, it is \nhighly unlikely that Acres would have paid him so much’.   \nThe amount paid to Bam exceeded the official salary Sole received himself, (Maloti 8,365.18 per month).    Acres conceded, in written submissions, that  \n‘…….For purposes of this case it is accepted that the payments from Bam to Sole were \nmade unlawfully, and this has already been found by another court of this Division in the case R v Sole’  The central question for the tribunal was this:  did Acres know that 60% of the funds it passed to Bam were then passed to Sole?  \n \n Lehohla J was in no doubt of the answer to this question.  At p61 of his judgment he said:  ‘In my view however it would defy common s ense that Acres should pay so much money \nas it did consistently over a period spanning the duration of this practice without knowing \nthat its money was being used through their agent to pay the Chief Executive of an organisation in which they had a direct interest……Furthermore it is inconceivable that he [Bam] would use this unlawful means of securing Acres’ interest by, as it were, rubbing the right way the only man who mattered, namely Sole, without Acres’ knowledge’. \n \nThe last three payments made by Acres to Bam, of $10,500 Canadian represented 40% of the earlier payments.  Acres argued that this reduction represented an adjustment of the money owed to Bam under a re-calculation  of the contract price.  The reduction in monthly payments occurred at almost the same calendar moment at which Sole lost his \napplication for judicial review of the decision to dismiss him, which the Crown alleged \nwas the clearest indication that with the end of his influence in the LHDA, there was no further purpose to be served in paying Sole.   Acres argued that this reduction was a bona fide consequence of their recalculation of what was owing to Bam under the terms of their agreement with him.  8.9 Defence Evidence \n8.9.1 Mr Witherell – Assistant Chief Executive at LHDA \n \n 189He was perhaps the best placed of all Acres personnel to give evidence in its defence, \nhe had provided an affidavit for the World Bank investigation, but was indisposed when the trial began. \n \n8.9.2. Mr Hare - Vice President of Acres, Overseas Business Director He gave evidence of Acres’  strong anti-corruption policy, and the due diligence which it used before entering an agreement with Mr Bam. He did not provide  documentary evidence to support this evidence, such as a written application on Bam’s behalf for the job, any other document setting out his qualifications for the position as Acres \nrepresentative, or references in support of his application.  Bam’s pre-existing \nrelationship as Lahmeyer’s agent had not, it seemed, been discovered, and the qualifications Bam had indicating his political  acumen, together with the benefits it would \nbring to Acres in the execution of Contract 65 were not addressed other than in the most general of terms.  There did not appear to be an appreciation on Mr Hare’s part of the \nconflict between Lescon, Bam’s engineer ing company and ACPM, his other \norganisation, either.  Mr Hare testified that it had been unintentional for Bam’s name to be omitted from the RA, and that his suspicions had not been aroused by the provision of a Swiss Bank \nAccount for payments to Bam under the Agreement.   \n Different drafts of the Agreement had been prepared, and sent for the approval of Acres Chairman. His Lordship took the view that in such a detailed procedure, there was no room for any error:  he found, at p112, that Acres intended  the Agreement to be with \nACPM, without reference to Bam himself or his wife.  What he described as \n‘peculiarities’ in the agreement led him inexorably to the conclusion that this agreement \nwas a vehicle to commit bribery.    Mr Hare gave evidence of another agreement between Acres and its representative in Zambia:  Acres, he said, used agents as a matter of course for overseas operations, \nwhen in unfamiliar territory.  It emerged as he was cross-examined that such \nagreements were far less frequently used than was first thought by Mr Hare.  Whilst he had suggested that ‘hundreds’ of such r epresentatives had been used by Acres, it \ntranspired that in fact only 28 agreements had been reached, over a period of 22 years, of which 21 had expired.  (see p116 of judgment)  \nMr Hare also testified to the boundaries of Mr Witherell’s job description.  Here he was \naddressing the impropriety of Mr Witherell, an Acres man, signing the authorisation for Acres payment in place of Sole, in advance of Contract 65 itself being signed.  Mr Hare maintained that although Mr Witherell received all the communications between LHDA, the World Bank and the JPTC, he did not and would not have passed information \nrelating to these on to Acres in Canada.  Lehohla J found this not to be credible, see \np120.  His Lordship found a number of aspects of Acres conduct which lacked the integrity to which the company laid claim in their policy statements.    Lehohla J was particularly ruthless about the evidence of Mr Hare, at the best criticising his selective memory , at worst viewing him as being deliberately untruthful in his \ninterpretation of events.  For example:  the minutes of a JPTC meeting of 19\nth \nSeptember 1990 were exhibited – the part relating to Contract 65 read as follows:   ‘Noted \n \n 190That although repeatedly requested from the LHDA no further information had been \nreceived regarding the status of the above Contract. Resolved \n2. That LHDA be informed that mobilisation of Acres personnel under the \n‘unawarded’ contract is not acceptable to JPTC. 3. That the above action by the LHDA without JPTC’s prior approval is in contravention of the Treaty, and that this fact is brought to the attention of the LHDA. 4. That the LHDA be advised to consider funding of the above services under VO \n(Variation Order) to TA1.’ \nThis showed that the LHDA, or Sole, had not in fact cooperated with the JPTC as \nrequired to do,  and as was suggested it had done, by Mr Hare.  In addition,  Acres obtained its bank guarantees from The Royal Bank of Canada, having represented that Contract 65 had been awarded to Acres, long before the conditions \nwithin the letter of intent had been met, or the contract signed.  To his Lordship, this \namounted to a deliberate misleading of the  Royal Bank.  At p130 of his judgment, he listed the reasons why he found Mr Hare’s ev idence to be inconsistent, contradictory and \nimprobable, and finally untruthful. Some of these reasons are summarised below:   Contract 65 was secured without Mr Bam’s assistance.   \nAcres had no need at this point for an agent in Lesotho \nNo clear  answer had emerged as to what precisely Mr Bam was to do for Acres. The due diligence applied by various members of Acres to the engagement of Mr Bam was arbitrary, inadequate and not in accordance with Acres stated policies. The fact that the representative agreement went through a series of drafts indicated that it was a carefully considered document, which was deliberately drafted thus, omitting the \nname of Mr Bam, whose name appeared on the bank accounts into which payments \nwere made.  It amounted to an insurance policy against the day when such payments might come to light.   Acres had a direct conflict of interest with Lahmeyer, consulting on LHDA.  The compromise of that conflict was epitomised by their joint instruction of Bam as their \ncompanies’ agent.   \nBy making payments in Switzerland to Mr Bam for work done in Lesotho, the Exchange Control Regulations of Lesotho were flouted by both parties to the agreement.   Acres at one stage shared lawyers with Sole, which appeared to his Lordship to be highly irregular, as did consulting with Sole over the trials.  \n8.9.3.  Mr Brown - Senior Representative for Acres at LHWP \nHis Lordship’s  view of the remaining defence evidence given by Acres personnel did not improve.  He found witness Mr Brown unwilling to answer questions with sufficient specificity, particularly those which dealt with the nature of his own relationship with Sole, Acres’ relationship with Sole, either of their relationships with JPTC, or the \nimplications of Lescon’s subconsultancies in the LHDA, either in the infrastructure, \nconstruction or engineering department.  Mr Brown did not appear to his Lordship to appreciate the conflict of interest betw een Lescon, (Bam’s company) and ACPM (the \nsignatory to the representation agreement), or that ACPM, Acres and Lahmeyer also breached the exclusion clause contained within Contract 65, by which a representative could only act exclusively in the interests of Acres.    His Lordship’s view was that Mr \nBrown did not address the validity of the representation agreement.  In general, he found \nthat the evidence given by Mr Hare and Mr Brown was untruthful:  at p162, he said  \n \n 191‘In a way Acres, by having them give evi dence in the manner they did, has shown its \ntrue colours namely that it is prepared to bend the truth in order to secure an acquittal.  A company which is prepared to do this will also  not shrink from paying bribes.  These two \nwitnesses came to extract Acres out of the bad situation and in the process have \nexposed it in worse light.  Never could the expression suit the situation more fittingly than they went for the wool and have come home shorn’  8.9.4. Mr Gourdeau Acres then called Mr Gourdeau, an expert witness who would give evidence on the use \nof representatives in engineering practice.  Mr Gourdeau’s brief appears to have been \nrather narrowly drawn:  he testified that he did not know much about the case itself, he had not read large parts of the Crown’s evidence and therefore was not in a position to comment specifically upon the aspects of the representation agreement which were put to him by the Crown.    He found himself unable to acknowledge that the Representation \nAgreement between Acres and ACPM could  be used as a vehicle for bribery.  His \nLordship found that Mr Gourdeau was not the objective and impartial witness he had been held out to be, by Acres, neither had he managed to reconcile what had happened here with international practice in the engagement of a bona fide  representative.  That \nfailure did not assist Acres. His Lordship commented on this in a telling passage; \n \n‘Sheep or springbok’ (p174) ‘This unreasonable refusal to acknowledge the obvious is much reminiscent of herd boys who were in the habit of stealing and eating a farmers sheep.  Because they feared that little boys who participated in the eating might let on that this act of illegality goes on in the veldt the bigger ones busied themselves drumming into the heads of little culprits \nthat this is not a sheep, but a springbok.  So it occurred that even where an innocent \nresemblance was noted between the hooves of the sheep and a springbok he was fetched a vicious blow with a cosh for mouthing that innocent observation within the hearing of the bigger herd boys who once more made him repeat after them ‘this here thing is not a sheep but a springbok’. \n \n8.9.5. Mr Gibb – Acres employee Acres called Mr Gibb, who testified that the reductions by 60% in payments to Bam were nothing to do with Sole’s unsuccessful application for a judicial review of his dismissal, and his final, failed bid to return to the LHDA, although the two events were almost contemporaneous. Mr Gibb explained that the r eduction arose from projections for Acres \ntotal service provision which were adjusted.  The timing of the adjustment of the \npayments was described by Mr Gibb as being ‘opportune’ because of an impending visit \nfrom Acres management.    Mr Gibb also testified that a reduction was required in the percentage which was due to \nBam.  Again, there seemed to be no overweening reason why the reduction should have \ntaken place at that particular moment.  No post signature written amendments to the RA emerged during the course of Acres evidence; in fact it appeared from Mr Gibb’s testimony that any variations in the agreement were dealt with verbally.  His Lordship’s view was that the absence of any written evidence of variations to the agreement indicated that Acres did not intend to be bound by its terms.  \n \nThe absence of invoices presented a substantial problem for Acres at the trial.  No guidelines were adduced by the company for t he remuneration of  their representatives, \nand accordingly there was no written record of the nature of the services performed for \n \n 192them by Bam, their expectations of him, or the basis on which he would be remunerated.  \nA range of exemplar agreements were adduced by Acres, to indicate their practice in other countries, which appeared to show the inconsistency in their approaches to the \nengagement of representatives.   \n 8.9.6. Mr Burnett – expert witness Mr Burnett was called by Acres to parry the evidence of Mr Roux.  The essence of his testimony was that there was no evidence of a contractual relationship between Acres and Sole, or any evidence to support the proposition that there was any intention on the \npart of  Acres to bribe Sole.  His Lordship found that Mr Burnett had not looked at the \naccounts themselves, but gave his evidence on the basis of his analysis of Mr Roux’s \nreport.   It appeared to His Lordship, that he had not ensured that he had seen the supporting documentation which would have enabled him to give a view on the authenticity of the representative agreement, (such as invoices issued under the \nagreement);  he nevertheless prefaced his repor t thus….’[this report] includes all matters \nrelevant to the issues on which [his] expert evidence is given.’ (p196)  He was not aware of the chronology leading to the signing of the Representative Agreement, neither did he know that Bam had been in Botswana for the period in question.  He was adamant that there was no basis for inferring a link between Sole and Acres, through the vehicle of \nBam’s bank accounts, that there was no observable pattern in the payments out.  He  \nappeared, to His Lordship, to give evidence which simply concurred with the earlier evidence of Mr Gibb, leading His Lordship to comment unfavourably once more upon a defence witness’ lack of impartiality.  This did more than not assist Acres, in His Lordship’s mind, as he indicates at p200 of the judgment:  \n‘The court thus naturally demurs at DW6’s [Burnett] partiality.  The fact that he \nexpressed views quite literally with blinkers on does not say much for his objectivity and his expertise.  What is more Acres bona fides are to large measure seriously compromised by all this to the extent that Acres were a party to DW6 entering the witness box with the benefit of a completely one-sided picture of what really happened in \nthis case.’   \n 8.9.7. Mr Meyer - Seconded from Lahmeyer, he had been a member of the Lesotho Delegation of the JPTC Acres called Johannes Meyer.  He had arrived in Lesotho in 1988, and staying until 1996.  He was asked to give evidence on the propriety with which Contract 65 had been \nnegotiated and signed.  He spoke of the role of the JPTC in negotiations, and testified \nthat the letter of intent in respect of this contract did not receive approval from the JPTC.  He also agreed that mobilisation had not been authorised by the LHDA or the JPTC, in contravention of the Treaty, that payment of the advance moneys to Acres was ‘highly \nirregular’, and that Contract 65 was signed without JPTC approval.   \n \n \n8.10 Judgment \n8.10.1 Acres evidence \nIn his colourful judgment, Lehohla J repeatedly alluded to the deception which in his view characterised the dealings which had involved money being transferred from \ncontractors and consultants working in Lesotho, into undeclared Swiss bank accounts, \nwhereupon it was moved once more into the accounts of Sole.  He found himself deeply unimpressed with the witnesses for the defence.  One of his principal criticisms was that they each appeared to be more concerned with presenting a positive interpretation of \n \n 193Acres’ conduct than they were with giving evidence in an appropriate and straightforward \nway.  His judgment, when assessing the defence evidence, repeatedly reflected his frustration that an obvious answer was not forthcoming to an obvious question.   \n \n8.10.2 Circumstantial evidence The law on circumstantial evidence was set out in R v Sole, by Cullinan AJ, and it was \nfollowed in his ruling by Lehohla J.  The principles had been set out in R v Blom 115,(see \nabove) and followed in the subsequent jurisprudence from which Lehohla derived his \nruling in Acres.  The evidence must be viewed, he said at (p 226), in its entirety;  the Court must then decide whether the inference of bribery is the only reasonable one which can be drawn from ‘the complete picture painted by all the established facts’. \n \nHe attached importance to the ruling in R v de Villiers 116: \n \n‘In a case depending upon circumstantial evidence….the Court must not take each circumstance separately and give the accused the benefit of any reasonable doubt as to the inference to be drawn from each one so taken.  It must carefully weigh the cumulative effect of all of them together and it is only after it has done so that the \naccused is entitled to the benefit of any reasonable doubt which it may have as to \nwhether the inference of guilt is the only inference which can reasonably be drawn.  To put the matter another way, the Crown must satisfy the court, not that each separate fact is inconsistent with the innocence of the accu sed, but that the evidence as a whole  is \nbeyond reasonable doubt inconsistent with innocence.     \nHe cited Lord Coleridge in R v J A Dickman 117  , who described the cumulative effect of \ncircumstantial evidence in a way which was positively poetic:   \n \n‘It is perfectly true…..that this is a case  of circumstantial evidence alone.  Now \ncircumstantial evidence varies infinitely in its strength and proportion to the character and variety, the cogency, the independence, one of another, of the circumstances.  I think one might describe it as a network of facts cast around the accused man.  The \nnetwork may be a mere gossamer thread, as light and unsubstantial as the very air itself.  \nIt may vanish at a touch.  It may be that, strong as it is in part, it leaves gaps and rents through which the accused is entitled to pass in safety.  It may be so close, so stringent, so coherent in its texture that no efforts on the part of the accused can break through.  It may come to nothing.  On the other hand, it may be absolutely convincing.  If we find a variety of circumstances, all pointing in the same direction, convincing in proportion to \nthe number and variety of those circumstances and their independence one of another, \nalthough each separate piece of evidence, standing by itself, may admit of an innocent interpretation, yet the cumulative effect of such evidence may be….overwhelming proof of guilt.  Ask yourselves then, what is the cumulative effect then upon your minds of so many, so varied, so independent pieces of evidence, all pointing, it is said, in one \ndirection, all tending, it is said, to inculpate the prisoner and the prisoner alone in the \ncommission of this crime?’.  8.10.3 The Representation Agreement \n                                            \n115 op cit \n116 1944 AD 493 \n117 1910 CAR 3200 \n \n 194The inferences the Crown had sought to persuade the Court to draw were that Acres \nknew that the money it paid to Bam was being used to pay Sole, and that the representation agreement Acres made with Bam amounted to an attempt to camouflage \nthe fact.   His Lordship concurred, regarding the RA as analogous to an alibi set up by a \ncriminal who anticipates the chance of detection.    The  performances of defence witnesses, as he added it all together, appeared to be characterised by vagueness, evasion and mendacity  over the spectrum of their evidence. The representation agreement itself between Acres and ACPM appeared to lack the sort of specificity which might have given it credibility: the chronology leading to the signing of Contract 65 \npointed, according to his Lordship, to the redundancy of the representation agreement in \nany event, but this was exacerbated by the in compatible or deceitful roles played by \nBam, Lescon, ACPM and the collection of  secret  bank accounts in Switzerland.  At p242, His Lordship commented thus:    \n‘I may add only for purposes of emphasis that where an accused gives false evidence, \nthe Court is at large to infer that there is something he wishes to hide, adding then an element of suspicion to the facts which may otherwise have been neutral’  \nCiting R v Bardhu 118, Lehohla J dealt with the incredibility of Acres defence: \n \n‘…the accused has given an explanation which has been rejected – one which cannot even possibly be true….the court should not….find on his behalf some explanation \nwhich, if given, might perhaps have been true, but which he himself has not given……..’  \n[per Lehohla J, ‘I agree entirely with this statement.]    The nub of His Lordships view is contained towards the end of his judgment, where he sets out a pragmatic perspective of the matter as he saw it: \n \n‘ The court is of a firm view that if Z.M. Bam could keep all the money he received from Acres for himself, he surely would have done so.  There is no suggestion based on any evidence that Z.M.Bam would have paid Sole out of generosity or some other obligation, contractual or otherwise.  Acres certainly haven’t offered any sensible explanation for the \npayments made by them to Z.M.Bam.  I need once more emphasise that no onus lies on \nAcres at all to prove its innocence….’  Lehohla J was unequivocal in his findings.  He took the view that the representation agreement was a sham, given the lie by the evidence before the court; that Acres knew \nthat Sole was being paid by Bam with money from Acres, that Acres benefited from \nbribing Sole, to the detriment of other competitors.  He found that Contract 65 had been \nunfairly awarded to Acres, and found the company guilty of the offences with which it had been charged.    The company’s public response to this verdict was public and unequivocal. In summary, \nit did not accept that it had received a fair trial: in its view, His Lordship had failed to \ngrasp the complexity of the issues before him, and it indicated that it had no doubt that the verdict would be overturned when the matter came before a more experienced \nbench of South African judges in the Lesotho Court of Appeal 119.   \n \n                                            \n118 1945 AD 813 \n119 Pat Adams press release collection \n \n 1958.11 Sentence. \nHis Lordship fined Acres $3.8 million (Canadian), which was in his calculation the sum \nwhich the company had made from Contract 65. His Lordship took the view that the \nscale of the bribery was in line with the scale of the project, and that the scale of the \nsentence should reflect the scale of that bribery, particularly since it was foreign sponsored corruption which was the most significant factor.  His Lordship commented on the ‘unique contemptuousness of their irresponsible remarks’ following the verdict in the trial, which he said were ‘superbly out of step’.  He was convinced that the bribery had taken place over a long period, secretly and carefully planned.  It was a course of \nconduct which had been deliberate, and for which the company had shown no remorse.  \nHis view was that it regretted that it had been caught.  At the hearing at which this sentence was imposed, Acres did not appear, and in mitigation did not supply any evidence to substantiate the claim they put forward that severe hardship would be felt by the employees who would be laid off by the im position of such a fine.  In a subsequent \nappeal, the Court ruled that the fine would be suspended pending the hearing of the \nappeal against the verdict and the sentence.    \n8.12 Acres Appeal \n Acres’ appeal was heard in the Appeal Court in Maseru, on 6\nth August 2003, before \nthree Judges  of Appeal:  Steyn P, Ramodibedi J A, Plewman JA.   Their Lordships noted in the preamble to their judgment, delivered on 15\nth August 2003, that there had \nbeen little dispute over the material facts of the case.  Acres had conceded, through their Counsel, that the payments which had been made by Bam to Sole had been funded by payments made by Acres to Bam.  Such  payments had been made unlawfully.  It was \nnot in dispute that the evidence adduced by the Crown concerning the pattern of \npayments placed an obligation upon Acres to ex plain their payments to Bam.  Without \nan acceptable explanation, then an inference could be drawn that Acres was guilty of bribery.    \nThe history of Acres involvement in the project, and the company’s relationship with Bam \nwas examined by their Lordships, from its early  involvement in Lesotho as a consultant \non the Lesotho Airport contract, through Contract 19, and its close involvement with LHDA, its relationship with Lescon, (Bam’s company), to the sole sourcing basis upon which it was awarded Contract 65.  Their Lordships examined the Representation Agreement, (RA) the exact manner in whic h Acres concluded Contract 65, and the \ntiming of the payments which were made by Acres into the Swiss bank account of Mr \nBam, from the initial payments until the moment when payments ceased.  They reviewed the oral evidence which had been given during the trial by individual witnesses.  The Crown’s case \n \nThe Crown argued, as it had in the lower court, that from the body of circumstantial evidence provided to the court, the only reasonable inference which could be drawn was that Acres knew that it was paying Bam to bribe Sole. It contended that the RA was a device used to conceal the true nature of the payments made, ultimately to Sole.  It \nmaintained that the pattern of payments into Bam’s Swiss bank accounts substantiated \nthe proposition that these were bribe monies.  The payments were not justified by the \nwork alleged to have been done by Bam, under the terms of the RA, neither were any invoices produced by Acres to indicate the exact nature of the services rendered for such payments. In addition, the payments had been shrouded in secrecy, with witnesses \n \n 196from the LHDA testifying that they did not observe Bam to have been involved in any of \nthe activities which were described in the agreement.  The Crown reiterated its invitation to the Court to draw further inferences from the fact that the payments had been made \ninto an overseas bank account. Their Lordships’ attention was drawn to the influential \nposition which Sole occupied ‘at all material times until after his dismissal in October 1995’, and the favour in which he held Acres, notwithstanding his non-compliance with the JPTC procedures which should have gover ned the awarding of all contracts.   \n Reasoning by inference \n \nTheir Lordships were clear that the appeal rested upon a single issue:    ‘..it is clear that the single issue which this Court is called upon to decide is whether the appellant has discharged the evidential burden it accepted.’ \n \nThey outlined the correct approach to adopt, when obliged by the nature of the evidence to reason by inference.  They observed that the problem was not unusual, and that the rules to be applied were ‘in no sense new’.  Their Lordships went on to review the law, set out in R v Blom 1939 AD 188.   \n \nIn summary, the court must look at the whole picture, as reflected in the second rule in Blom:    ‘when reasoning by inference, a conclusion on the basis that the inference sought to be drawn is consistent with all the proved facts, can only be drawn if the proved facts are \nsuch that they exclude every reasonable inference save the one sought to be drawn’.   \n The nature of inferential reasoning had been at the heart of Acres’ trial, and their Lordships saw it as being at the heart of their appeal.  .  \nIn an essay entitled ‘Fiat Justitia’ (Essays in Memory of Oliver Deneys Schreiner), H C \nNicholas, (referred to by their Lordships as the learned judge), discussed the rules relating to inferential reasoning and their relationship to the onus which rests with the prosecution in a criminal case.  An excerpt from this essay appears in the judgment, and is reproduced below, since it sets out the refinements of the rule in Blom.  \n‘The second rule of logic in Blom is a saluta ry rule, whose field or application is limited \nby its nature.  It is a tool for detecting and av oiding fallacy, for testing the logical validity \nof a conclusion.  It is no more than that.  It is not a legal precept.  It is not another way of stating the criminal standard of proof.  It does not in itself provide an automatic answer to the question whether guilt has been proved beyond a reasonable doubt.  Even if the rule \nis satisfied, it does not follow that the trier of fact must convict the accused.  It does not \nlicence speculation as to facts not proved by the evidence, nor does it mean that the State is obliged to close every avenue of escape which  might otherwise be open to an accused.  In investigating other reasonable inferences, the field of inquiry may be limited by the fact that the accused has given an expla nation, or by the fact that he has failed to \ngive an explanation where one was called for in the circumstances.’ \n \nAccordingly, their Lordships would not take each circumstance separately, giving Acres the benefit of reasonable doubt for each one.  The court’s duty was ‘to weigh the cumulative effect of all the proven facts taken together’ and thereafter consider its \n \n 197conclusions on the basis of the inference it has drawn.  Their Lordships referred to the \njudgment of Marais A.J.A., in Moshephi and Others v R (1980-1984) L.A.C. 57, where he said,  \n \n‘There is no substitute for a detailed and critical examination of each and every component in a body of evidence.  But, once that has been done, it is necessary to step back a pace and consider the mosaic as a whole.  If that is not done, one may fail to see the wood for the trees’.  \nThe court must consider other possible inferences which may be drawn from proved \nfacts.  If any of them is reasonable, then the inference of guilt cannot be drawn.  This does not mean, however, that the court may speculate on the possible existence of other facts which might justify the same conclusion.  However, an explanation proffered by an accused will not give rise to an inference of guilt if it is reasonable.   \n \nTheir Lordships, having observed that certain evidence had been admitted in the lower court which was inadmissible, took the view that the correct approach was ‘to consider the importance and effect of such evidence and weigh it in the overall balance.’  The evidence which they regarded as being inadmi ssible was that which related to payments \nmade by other contractors which found their way to Sole.  In addition, their Lordships \nruled that the court of first instance had misd irected itself, on the Crown’s submissions \non a possible contravention of the currency regulations by Bam, aided and abetted by Acres, however, such misdirections were viewed as inconsequential.   The RA \n \nTheir Lordships considered the RA, to determine whether it was a genuine contract, or a sham, to be used as a conduit for bribery.  They reviewed the evidence before the lower court: the circumstances leading up to the signing of Contract 65; sole-sourcing; the document itself; the nature of the services to be performed, under the RA; arrangements \nfor payment under the RA, and the manner in which changes were made, after Sole’s \nemployment was terminated.  They observed that ACPM was an entity which was never formally constituted, and unknown to anyone other than Bam and Acres. Using the name ‘ACPM’ had the effect of disguising the identity of the recipient of the funds paid by Acres, although Acres were \naware who they were paying.  The inference drawn from this by Lehohla J was, in their \nview, correct. They also observed that the only changes to the RA were to the arrangements for payment, nothwithstanding ‘material developm ents’ in the relationship between Acres \nand LHDA.   Arrangements for payment served to ‘buttress’ the inference which was \ndrawn: payments to a non-existent agency, called ACPM, in a nominated Swiss bank \naccount number; the transaction itself was recorded in ‘obscure or opaque terminology’, evidenced in letters between Hare and Bam, which led their Lordships to agree with Lehohla J that the evidence given by Hare was mendacious.   The services to be performed under the terms of the RA were examined by their \nLordships, as was the evidence which was given by witnesses from LHDA of the need \nfor such services.  Acres maintained, through the evidence of Hare, and in its representations during the World Bank investigation that the agreement required Bam to provide political intelligence.  This requirement was not reflected in the terms of the \n \n 198Schedule to the agreement, where the services had been set out.  The evidence of Hare \nand Brown was re-read by their Lordships, who found that the lower court had correctly rejected it. \n \nAcres contended that the RA was in the tradition of standard international practice, which was accepted by their Lordships. However, what was not accepted was that the cost of using Bam was built into the contract price.  Their Lordships could see no justification for such a cost, in the light of the services provided by Bam, which were conceded to have been flimsy, and which their Lordships viewed judged to be of no \nsignificance.  ‘Bam could have played no role in securing the contract, and in fact played \nno such role’.  They found the evidence in the lower court that Bam had been employed in Botswana at the time when Acres was engaged on the contract was reliable.  Moreover, since Acres had been ‘extensively and lengthily’ involved in Lesotho during the eighties, then there was no need for a representative.  Their Lordships concluded \nthat Bam had not in fact rendered the services which were set out in the RA.  The \npayments he received were in any event disp roportionately high, either for the services \nhe did render under the contract or otherwise.  The payments \n \nTheir Lordships went on to analyse the patterns and amounts of payments made by Acres to Bam, the inferences which the Court had been invited to draw therefrom, and Acres attempts to explain such payments.  Agreeing with Lehohla J, they took the view that the evidence of the Swiss Bank records and the forensic report of Jean Roux would, ‘in the absence of an acceptable explanation, constitute damning support for the \nCrown’s contention’.  In particular, they looked at the evidence of Gibbs, which was to \naddress the point that the money paid to Bam was reduced in January 1997.  Their Lordships were unconvinced that this reduction was under the terms of the RA, which they thought unjustified. In particular, they noted the extraordinary co-incidence of the timing, since it coincided exactly with Sole’s final departure from the LHDA, and with \nthat, the conclusion of the services he had been able to render to Acres.   \n In reviewing the other evidence adduced by the Crown to support their contention that Acres had made payments to Bam knowing that a proportion of those payments were destined for Sole, their Lordships did not single such submissions out for individual debate.  They concluded that, having reviewed the evidence, they had followed the \nCourt’s ruling in Moshepi and Others v Rex, in ‘looking at the mosaic as a whole’, and in \ndoing so, had concluded that Acres had not provided a satisfactory explanation for the body of evidence pointing to the conclusion that they had bribed Sole.  Acres appeal in respect of Count 1 therefore failed.  \nCount 2. \n This count related to money which was paid into Mrs Bam’s account, no part of which was ever paid to Sole.  The Crown had invited the court to infer, in the absence of an explanation for the payment, that the same intention should be ascribed to this payment as to those charged under Count 1.  Their Lordships, having used the same reasoning, \nand examined all the circumstances surrounding th is one off payment, took the view that \nthere was a reasonable doubt that Acres intended to bribe Sole with this money, and accordingly allowed the appeal to succeed.  \n \n 199Sentence. \n Counsel for Acres submitted that the lower court had failed to take into account the \nconsequences of a bribery conviction for the company.  He also submitted that Lehohla \nJ had ‘overemphasised what it perceived to  be aggravating circumstances and the need \nfor deterrence’.  Their Lordships began consideration of the sentence by reviewing the correct approach to be taken in sentencing a corporation.  Whilst it was correct that an offending company \nshould be obliged to part with its illegally gained profits, the court should not ignore other \nrelevant considerations, and simply settle on a sentence which equated to the financial benefits which had been reaped by the corporation.  There was also a requirement for consistency between offenders which had been convicted of the same crime.  In this case however, trying to find a monetary equivalent to the sentence of 12 years \nimprisonment imposed upon Sole was ‘well-nigh  impossible’, so a fresh approach would \nbe taken.  First, the sentence would only reflect punishment for Count 1, since the appeal on Count 2 had succeeded.  Second, the lower court had, in the opinion of their Lordships, had over-emphasized the aggravating features of the crime, when considering sentence, and minimized the mitigating features which were on the record.  \nThese latter were  \n ‘the extra-curial impact the conviction will have, not only on the corporation itself, but \nalso on its employees who number some 1000 persons.  The reputation of the appellant will be sullied by the conviction and it will live in  the shadow of the taint of the corruption.  \nAs an international corporation it is to a considerable extent dependent on project \nactivities undertaken and funded by development agencies both international such as \nthe World Bank and by national governments.  Its capacity to be gainfully involved in \nsuch work will for some time be seriously and negatively impacted.  Such profits as it may have made on Contract 65, will, we are certain, be dissipated by not only the very large fine we intend to impose, but also by all the costs it incurred in the various \nprotracted proceedings not only in these courts, but also before the World Bank.  Its \ntravails are also by no means over.  An embargo by the World Bank and other \ninstitutions such as e.g. donor agencies is no remote possibility’.     Their Lordships nevertheless viewed the offence as one of extreme gravity.  They alluded to the evidence of Camerer,  on the effects of corruption within civil society, and \nreviewed the recent judgments for the same offence.  They quoted Cullinan AJ, in R v \nSole:    ‘Corruption is inimical to sound public administration, itself essential to the strength of constitutional democracy;  it also threatens  investor confidence, development projects \nand employment including in Lesotho’ \n and went on as follows:  ‘We endorse these sentiments.  Lesotho is a small land-locked \ncountry.  It has limited resources.  Its economic development was seriously damaged \nbecause of the policies and actions of its large and powerful neighbour and the sanctions imposed on that country.  The LHWP was a visionary initiative to put the \ncountry back on the road to recovery.  It’s cynical exploitation by the appellant – \nmotivated as it was by greed, - is the more reprehensible.’  \n \n 200Their Lordships commented on the need to exclude anger from the sentencing \nprocedure, and took particular note of the courage, determination and competence shown by the Lesotho authorities in bringing such prosecutions.  ‘…they set an example \nof good governance and have delivered a blow on behalf of all countries who face major \nchallenges in strengthening their infrastructure through project activity.  This Court particularly commends the Director of Public Prosecutions and his team for their dedicated and resolute efforts.’  Acres was fined M15 million. \n \nAt the time of writing, M13 million remains unpaid.  Conclusion Acres’ appeal marked the end of a long and expensive matter.  Their Lordships were \nunequivocal in their assessment of the trial in the lower court.  In commenting on the \ncolourful judgment of Lehohla J, they remarked that ‘the simple fact is that the record shows that the appellant was given a fair trial and that there is not the slightest indication or suggestion to the contrary’.  Whilst the second count was successfully appealed, and the sentence marginally reduced, the central issues upon which the court of first \ninstance had been asked to rule were left largely undisturbed. \n   \n9. MUTUAL LEGAL ASSISTANCE - THE ROLE OF  OECD \n \n9.1 The OECD Convention and “past offences” \nA number of the parties involved in payments wh ich were made directly or indirectly to \nSole were companies registered in states which are parties to the OECD.

CHECK   Contract 117   \nThe OECD Convention Combating Bribery of Foreign Public Officials in International \nBusiness Transactions came into force in 1999. Signatories to the Convention must already be members of the Working Group, they must have accepted the Revised Recommendation of 1997 of the Council on Combating Bribery, together with the \nRecommendation on the Tax Deductibility of  Bribes of Foreign Public Officials 120.   \n \nThe overall purpose of the Convention is to prevent bribery in international business, to which end it requires those countries which have signed and ratified it to establish the \n                                            \n120 For full text, see www.oecd.org. \n \n 202criminal offence of bribing a foreign public  official, as well as the means by which \ndetection of the offence might be achieved.  The offence of bribery for member countries   \nMust apply to all persons.  \nMust apply to  the offering, promising or giving of a bribe, regardless of the use of intermediaries or if the advance is for a foreign public official or a third party Must apply regardless of the form the bribe takes: the offering of any advantage may be \ncaught by the offence Must prohibit bribery for obtaining or retaining ‘business or other improper advantage in \nthe conduct of international business’.   \nThe definition of ‘foreign public official’ in cludes any person holding a legislative, \nadministrative or judicial office, any person ex ercising a public function or any official or \nagent of a public international organisation.    \nParties have requirements to satisfy under the Convention: \nEffective, proportionate and dissuasive crim inal penalties must be imposed for the \noffence of foreign bribery – although where the legal system does not admit criminal corporate liability, non criminal penalties must be applied. Jurisdiction:  this must be established where an offence is committed in whole or in part \nin its territory.  Where a party already has jurisdiction to prosecute nationals abroad, the \noffence of foreign bribery must be established according to the same principles. Money laundering:  where an offence has been established in relation to domestic bribery, the same offence must be established in relation to foreign bribery. Certain accounting and audit practices liable to conceal foreign bribery are to be prohibited. \nMutual legal assistance must be shown between Parties.   \nBribery of a foreign public official will be an extraditable offence, under the laws of the Parties and the extradition treaties existing between them.  .   Detailed and substantial measures have been taken to monitor the implementation of \nparties obligations under the Convention, using a two-part peer reviewed process of \nquestionnaires and evaluation.    The  OECD has done much to build an anti-corruption framework, exemplified in its OECD Principles of Corporate Governance.  There are revised Guidelines which contain recommended measures to prevent the furnis hing and solicitation of bribes.  There are \ninitiatives which address the demand side of bribery, such as the 1998 OECD Council \nRecommendation on Improving Ethical Conduct in Public Service.  Other initiatives address the need for co-operation with Non OECD economies.   \n9.2 Points for consideration by members of the OECD. \nIn summary, the OECD initiatives have heralded a new approach towards the excision of \ncorruption from the economic community.  Wh ilst some consider progress to be slow, \nthere is nevertheless evidence of a seismic shift away from the notion that corruption is a norm of business.   However encouraging this groundshift towards the eradication of corruption appears, certain questions remain at large.    \nWhere will a government’s competing duties lie, when an allegation of corruption \nemerges from the dealings of a company whic h has received export credit insurance for \nthe contract in question?  In a company which is in constant dialogue with its \n \n 203government over a wide range of issues, how  can the decision not to prosecute be seen  \nto be an impartial one?    \nWhat domestic political pressures might be applied to a government considering such a \nprosecution?  For example, in the case of Acres, during the mitigation which preceded the  sentence it received, (which remains suspended until the appeal has been heard),  the company suggested, although it did not produce evidence in support, that jobs in its workforce would be threatened by the imposition of a heavy fine.  This made no appreciable impression upon Judge Lehohla, who drew comparisons between the \nconsequences of unemployment for Canadians and for Basutos.  Had such a \nprosecution taken place in Canada, what might have been the effect of such mitigation?    Whether a prosecution of Acres would ever have taken place in Canada is an interesting question.  How would such an investigation have been conducted?  The verdict of the \ntrial in the High Court in Maseru, largely upheld by the Court of Appeal, lies uneasily next \nto the Code of Conduct used by Acres to govern its dealings, from which the company has repeatedly made the point that it has a completely clean record in this area, and a clear company policy forbidding bribery.    \nThe jurisdictional issue:  practically, as the OECD Convention is gradually implemented, \nwho will now decide in which jurisdiction an alleged offence should be tried?  For example, consider the position of the Lesotho government where the Canadian \ngovernment had looked at prosecuting Acres, but then decided not to do so? Would the Lesotho authorities have gone on to make a decision to prosecute, themselves?  What criticisms might have been leveled at them for doing so, where the Canadians had \ndecided not to?    \n It is a wide spread view amongst those who study corruption that transparency is the most powerful weapon to use in its defeat.  In any decision to prosecute or not, the reasoning behind  that decision (particularly where the decision is not to proceed,)  will \nhave to open itself to some degree of scrutiny if it is to be an effective part of the \ntransparent process.  Comparisons between judicatures are inevitable.  In Cullinan AJ’s judgment, he sets out the markers of corruption.  His ruling was that the offence is committed at the point when an agreement between briber and bribee is reached.  It is very unlikely, given the nature \nof such an agreement, that there will be any direct evidence of its existence; the only \nevidence is likely to be circumstantial.  How will evidence of this sort, gathered in one country or countries  be sure of compliance with the evidential rules of a third jurisdiction?  \nWhat steps, if any, are now being taken by any  OECD country to investigate the Lesotho \nactivities in Lesotho of companies registered within their jurisdiction, in accordance with their obligations under the spirit of the Anti-Bribery Convention, to cooperate with other states in the eradication of bribery and corruption?   To mount a full criminal investigation of each company’s activities with cooperating teams of lawyers specialising in this kind \nof work, in the light of Judge Cullinan’s rulings, would be prohibitively expensive for the \nLesotho government. This would be a perfect opportunity for concerned member \ncountries to come in behind the Lesotho prosecuting team with support.  The opportunity has not been taken thus far.   During research for this article, on more than one occasion this question has arisen:  If OECD countries are so uninterested in supporting a series of \n \n 204prosecutions of companies registered within their jurisdiction , what inferences should be \ndrawn from that apparent reluctance?    \nSome major obstacles have been placed in the way of prosecution by companies \nchanging their identities, or being sold, and so forth. 121, with the consequence that  they \nare not, or are no longer the named defender. For example, Spie Batignolles \nunsuccessfully ran this argument as a preliminary issue before its trial resumes later in 2004.  Other companies have evaded or avoided prosecution by similar moves. The complexity and ensuing expense which would be incurred by the Lesotho Government as it traced the assets of the company  originally charged would be prohibitive.  Lesotho is an impoverished country:  half of its two million population live below the poverty line, \nand according to WB statistics, GNP per capita is $540.  Such added expenses would \nimpact further upon the domestic economy.   \n \n                                            \n121 Research on these issues will be included in t he up date on this paper being prepared for TIRI (the \ngovernance access-learning network) in t he autumn of 2004 . See www.tiri.org. \n \n 20510 LESSONS FROM THE LESOTHO TRIALS TO BE LEARNT BY OTHER \nDEVELOPING COUNTRIES CONSIDERING  PROSECUTION OF A COMPANY FOR \nBRIBERY. \n \n10.1 Funding.    \nThe promise of financial assistance enabled the Lesotho government to decide to \ncommence a series of extremely complex and expensive prosecutions.  The subsequent absence of  funds has impeded the rate at which such prosecutions have been able to be brought.  The prosecuting authorities would have benefited immeasurably from the \nopportunity to conduct swift investigations, (with the meaningful cooperation of other \nstate authorities), into some of the European registered companies who have been squarely implicated in the matter by their indirect payments to Sole.  Neither the means nor the cooperation has been forthcoming from any OECD member countries.     \nA country to whom financial assistance has been offered will need to establish ways in \nwhich such a promise can be kept.  \n10.2 Outside assistance. \nBribery is notoriously difficult to detect and prosecute.  For the due process of a trial to be perceived as beyond suspicion, it is re commended that  expertise independent of the \nprosecuting authority is engaged in circumstances where there may be scarce local experience of the legal complexities of such trials.  In developing countries, lawyers possessing such expertise are as yet  liable to be in short supply.   The corollary of that will be the avoidance of any suggestion of corruption within the due process of the trial.  Where bribery on an international scale is alleged to occur, then it is likely that the \nprosecuting authority itself may have been vulnerable to bribery.    \n \n10.3 Mutual legal assistance. \nWhere bribery appears to have reached international proportions, meaningful and \nprompt mutual legal assistance is essential.  Such assistance in these trials has come \nfrom the Swiss authorities, but no other European country has distinguished itself thus, \nduring the investigations to date. The Lesotho prosecutors were very substantially assisted by the cooperation and abilities of Mme Cova, the examining Swiss magistrate \nresponsible for revealing Sole’s Swiss bank accounts.  Without this sort of prompt assistance, there is a real danger that the will to prosecute will be inevitably eroded by the political will of a government, for example where it is facing an election.   \n \nIn Lesotho, through the list system of proportional representation, Sole (notwithstanding his imprisonment for corruption) was elected to Parliament as a member of the Opposition Basutho National Party.  It was that party’s express intention, had they won the election in June 2002, to drop the investigations.  One can speculate upon the \nassociations which led to such an interesting state of affairs, but this feature of the cases \nsimply underlines the necessity for prompt  cooperation between governments over this \ntype of prosecution.  \n10.4 Political concerns \nThe Lesotho government has found the weight of these trials ‘onerous and burdensome’.  Lesotho is a small country, with few natural resources, not much manufacturing industry \nand a currently shrinking economic base.  The main cash flows in the past have been from remittances sent by miners working in South Africa.  This source is dwindling, owing to conditions in the mining industry and the depreciated value of the rand.  The \n \n 206financing of a prosecution of this sort has been an extremely expensive business at the \nbest of times, since it required the briefing of Senior and Junior Counsel from Durban, and the engagement of forensic consultants.  \n \nConcerning the appointment of Judge Cullinan, the Lesotho government representative to whom I spoke, explained the decision to app oint an expatriate judge, a former Chief \nJustice of Lesotho, giving two reasons:   (i).  These are very high profile cases.  The accused companies are very well known \nnames in the construction  industry, and vulnerable to the reputational damage which \nwould accrue from any  conviction.  It was anticipated that the accused companies would take all the technical points they possible could, to obstruct the prosecution.  This has turned out to be a prophetic view.    An experienced judge was required who would be able to command credibility by reason of his long experience, and who could provide \ncomprehensive rulings within a reasonable time, so as not to delay matters unduly.  \nCullinan AJ was finally required to rule on at least ten preliminary applications.   Each ruling was comprehensive and meticulous, and it could not be said that there had not been a fair trial of all of the issues.  \n(ii).  There could be no suggestion that the trials were unfair or corrupt, if they were \nconducted by a prestigious judge brought in from outside Lesotho.   \n10.5 Funding. \n \n10.5.1 World Bank \nConcerning funding, the Bank was one of a number of institutions which made a \ncommitment to provide financial support to the Lesotho Government for the trials.  Subsequently they resiled from that decisi on.  Although they remained concerned to \nassist, and indeed have done so substantially with the provision of documentation and \nso forth, no funding was finally forthcoming.  They had not been obliged to make such a \ncommitment, and they were not obliged to give reasons for their change of heart.  The \nconsequence of the absence of any funding from any outside source for these trials has \nbeen the diversion of Lesotho resources from other, more deserving sources.    The World Bank has responded to my questions on the subject thus:  \nThe Bank is a development bank: its mandate does not contain a budget for funding \nlitigation.  The Bank has explored a number of options for financial assistance for the Lesotho authorities, but all involved the Government borrowing money, which it was unwilling to do. Had it made a direct financial contribution to the prosecution of these trials, then this \nwould have set a precedent which might prove troublesome for the Bank in the future: \nfor example, where a country proposed litigation which was doubtful of success, or where the legal system lacked integrity and could not ensure a fair trial of the issues.  10.5.2 European Investment Bank (EIB) When EIB was appraised of the corruption which had gone on, EIB decided to conduct \nits own audit.  It was provided with access to all documentation, and in a written answer \nto a question put by an MEP, indicated that since the money it had lent was not used in any of the projects which were currently the subject of scrutiny, then it would not proceed further with the matter. \n \n 207 \nIn a written answer to Dr Caroline Lucas, MEP, dated November 28th 2002, D de \nCrayencour wrote thus: \n‘In addition to its regular monitoring, in 2000 the EIB commissioned an audit on its own \ninitiative in order to determine possible implications of irregular practices on the project components it had funded under Phase 1A…..This audit was closely coordinated with the European Commission and with OLAF, the specialised EU antifraud institution, and concluded that: There was no direct or specific misuse of EIB funds; \nIndirect misuse of EIB funds could not be proven; for each of the contracts financed by \nEIB real services and goods had been delivered to the project.’  The audit was made available to OLAF and the Lesotho prosecutors.    \nA slightly different answer was given to the questions posed by MEP Di Pietro by \nCommissioner Nielson.  The questions were as follows:  ‘1. Does the Commission intend to honour the promise of financial support for the government of Lesotho to enable the corruption case to be carried to its conclusion in \nthe High Court? \n2 Does the Commission intend to check whether the EDF and the  EIB showed due diligence in relation to the grants and loans granted in connection with the Lesotho Highlands Water Project? Does the Commission intend to make every effort to ensure that companies found guilty of corruption are excluded from any future projects financed by development assistance \nand Member States export credit agencies or with funds from EU institutions?’ \n Commissioner Nielson responded thus: ‘P-3211/02EN Answer given by Mr Nielson \non behalf of the Commission \n(7 January 2003)  The case, to which the Honourable Member refers, concerns a large construction project in Lesotho which was co-financed by the European Development Fund (EDF) together with several other international donors.  \n \nThe question regarding the possible reactions of the export credit agencies of the Member States and regarding eventual sanctions taken by the European Investment Bank is outside the scope of the Commission’s competencies.   \nSince the questions refer to ongoing criminal court cases, the issue should be \nconsidered carefully with due regard for the right of defence of the companies and persons involved and the presumption of innocence.  The Honourable Member refers to a promise which the Commission should have made to finance the costs of the Lesotho court case. For this, the Honourable Member bases \nhimself on an article published in a South African newspaper. \n The Commission cannot confirm that any  such promise was ever made. \n \n \n 208In addition, the present case is pending before a criminal court handled by the Public \nprosecutor. It would seem to be falling outside the EDF’ s mandate to finance a particular criminal law suit against particular individual companies.  \n \nWith regard to the specific company to which the Honourable Member refers, the Commission should further point out that the contracts awarded to this company were not financed by the EDF, but by other donors.   In the first part of 2000, the Commission engaged independent auditors to examine \nwhether EDF funds had been misused.  They were asked to analyse whether the \nawarding of the contracts, riders, variation, orders, etc had been executed properly, or might have been biased to favour certain contractors.   The general conclusion from this audit was that it was not possible to demonstrate that \nthere had been a direct misuse of EDF funds. The audit revealed that even if there had \nbeen any misuse, for the EDF such a misuse was not likely to be large; since the EDF \nfunding was topped at a fixed amount, the principal victim of any misuse seemed to be the Government of Lesotho, who had to finance any expenditure not covered by the \ndonors. ……’. [emphasis added] \n \nThe Commissioner went on to state that the EU procurement rules in respect of companies convicted of corrupt practices prev ent  such companies from invitations to \ntender or from future contracts.  \n10.6 The expenses of the trials \n10.6.1 Sole \nIt was a matter of great importance to the Lesotho authorities that Sole be given, and be seen to be given, a fair trial.  By the conclusion of the civil proceedings, Sole had no money left.  Judgment against him had been given in the sum of M8.9 million, and his house and property were sequestered.  As he faced his criminal prosecution, he made a \nsuccessful application for Legal Aid, which meant that the Lesotho government now paid \nfor both his prosecution and his defence.   10.6.2 Acres In principle, costs are not recoverable from the Defendant in a criminal trial.   Whilst some of the expenditure on the trials could be recouped by the imposition of fines upon \nthe company,  this was uncertain.  Acres has yet to pay the balance of its fine, and if it \nwere refuse to pay the balance, (M13 milli on), the Lesotho Governme nt would have to \ninstitute enforcement proceedings against the Company.  Such proceedings would almost inevitably be in Canada, involving the Government in yet further expensive litigation. \n \n10.7 Mutual legal assistance. \nThe prosecuting authorities in Lesotho have been at pains to emphasise that they were \ngiven the most comprehensive and timely support by the Swiss authorities.  Such support has not been forthcoming in their dealings with other authorities concerning companies registered in their jurisdictions.     \n \nThe Government of Lesotho is heavily committed to  eradication of corruption of this sort, \nbeing aware of the sort of benefits which Sole was capable of bestowing from his position  \n \n 209of influence.  Such benefits included the tangible and intangible benefits of his position, \ntogether  with his capacity for patronage and a quiet word in the  appropriate ear.  It was also a matter of grave concern to the Government that someone facing such corruption \ncharges should have been included in the list of candidates for election by the Basutho \nNational Party.  How Sole was able to get into such a position as he faced criminal prosecution is a matter of conjecture.  Such political manoeuvring only increased the pressure under which the Government has already found itself.  \n11 THE WAY FORWARD \n \nLegislative steps have been taken in OECD countries which are designed to facilitate the prosecution of bribery in those countries. An omission, however, in civil law countries such as France and Germany, has been to render corporations liable for criminal conduct. This creates a gaping hole in the OECD framework.  \n \nAt a practical level, in less well-off countries, the investigative procedures leading up to the issue of a summons will often be a major expense to be borne by the government.  There is a strong argument for the international community, either under the auspices of the World Bank or the UN, to provide an international team of forensic analysts/auditors, \nwho would be available to assist in the investigative process in appropriate cases.   \n Also at a practical level, there is a strong argument for the international financial community to provide a recipient country, at its request, with the free use of an independent  financial advice team, to examine the probity of companies looking to do \nbusiness there. Where the institutional capacity of a country has not yet been fully \ndeveloped, this sort of assistance may be welcome.  Such a team might assist over a \nwide range of aspects of a major project, including assessments of corporate probity, tendering, insurance and project finance, accounting, time-line analyses and the law.  Legal aspects of such assistance might also include drafting provisions within a contract for penalties for bribing.  In this context it should be noted that although the World Bank \npublishes the corporations it has debarred from bidding for World-Bank-financed \nprojects, other IFIs and development agencies do not do so. \n \n \n \n \n \n 210ANNEX 1, Lesotho Highland Water Case Study; \nQUESTIONS FOR DISCUSSION \n \n Case Study Working Groups \n \nAll students must read the ca se study up to 8.9.7. bef ore class and stop there. \n During the course, the parti cipants will be divided into three working groups.  One \nthird of the students will be pl aced in the role of the pr osecutor, one-third in the \nrole of the defense attorney, and one-third in the role as the jury .  The trainer will \nplay the rule of the judge.  Each group will be in  charge of developing a short br ief of their case and  main \narguments, what motions they would pr opose, and what further evidence they \nwould need to move forward.  Additiona lly they should come  up with their own \nidea of what type of judgm ent they believed that the case resulted in.   \n Once this is done, a class discussion sh ould follow.  The prosecutor group must \nfirst present their case and ideas.  Following them, the defense group should \npresent their case.  Then the jury group should make their decision based on the \narguments of both.    As a group, the whole class can read t he judgment together and compare reality \nto what transpired in class. \n \n \n \n 211ANNEX \n \nTrial Countdown: \n \nMay 2002 – Masupha Ephraim Sole, former chief executive officer of the Lesotho \nHighlands Development Authority found guilty of 11 counts of bribery and two counts of \nfraud.  \nJune 4, 2002 – Mr. Sole sentenced to 18 years in jail.
