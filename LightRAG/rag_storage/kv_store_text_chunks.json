Wh ile there are benefits in outsourcing such \nservices, the processes of c ontract letting and monitoring of service deliverables are \nprone to corrupt practices, causing financial loss to the organizations or companies and \ndamages to their reputation. \nThis Best Practice Checklist (BPC) aims to provide organi zations and companies with \na user-friendly guide on the procedures and safeguards to prevent malpractice in the \nletting and administration of cleaning and s ecurity contracts, c overing invitation of \ntenders, selection of contractors, award of  contracts, and monitoring of service \nstandards. Users of the BPC are advised to adapt the recommended measures to suit their \nrespective organizational structure, resource  capability, operational needs, and risk \nexposures. \nThe Advisory Services Group of the Co rruption Prevention Department of ICAC \nstands ready to provide free, confiden tial, and tailor-made corruption prevention \nadvice to private compani es on request, including how to apply the practices \nrecommended in this BPC.

The approving authority should \nbe at the senior management level. \n• Restrictive tendering or quotation – Procure \nservices below a specified amount by inviting a specified number of contractors sourced from an \napproved list or the market ( 2.3). The level of \napproving authority should be determined by the value of purchases (usually restrictive tendering for purchases of higher value and quotation for \npurchases of lower value). \nDetermine whether a two-enve lope system is necessary \n(i.e. for high value purchases where price is not the only consideration, contractors are required to submit \nservice and price proposal\ns in separately sealed \nenvelopes for assessment). \nRequire all staff involved in the procurement process to \ndeclare any perceived or actua l conflict of interest (e.g. \na staff m\nember responsible for evaluating tenders has \nfinancial interest in the business (e.g. holding shares) of \na tenderer) and, in case of declared conflict, take steps \nto remove the conflict by  assigning another staff \nmember to take over the job or  requiring a supervisor to \nclosely monitor the process. \nInstruct all staff involved in the process to avoid \nover-socialising with or accepting excessive or lavish \nentertainment from the contractors. \nRequire all staff to keep sensitive information obtained  \nin the procurement process confidential. \n2 \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n  \n Segregate duties, as far as practicable, by assigning \ndifferent staff members to take charge of different \nprocesses, such as sourcing contractors ( 2.3), \npreparing service co\nntract agreements ( 2.10) and \nm\nonitoring service deliverables ( 2.11). \nRegularly review the policies and guidelines for \nprocurement to ensure they are up to date. \n2.2 Purchase Requests and Specifications of Service \nUser Identify the need for cleani ng or security service, \nand draw up the scope of service required, using a \nPurchase \n Requisition  Form (sample  at \nAppendix 1 ). \nSubmit the Purchase Requisition Form to the \napproving authority for endorsement. \nApproving Ascertain the need for th e service requested and \nAuthority check the budget before approval. \nUser/ Prepare an invitation for quot ations or tenders (i.e. \nProcurement a tender/quotation document) which should contain \nStaff the following service specifications, seeking \ntechnical input or legal advice as necessary: \nBackground information of bidders, such as \nsize of company, years of previous experience in similar contracts, client reference if any, \netc. (for the purpose of shortlisting or \npre-qualifying bidders). \nSpecification of service requirements and \nstandard of service, for example: \nFor cleaning contracts – coverage of service, frequency of cleaning or refuse collection, \nnumber of cleaning workers and supervisors, \nsupervision plans, records of service, response time to requests for urgent cleaning tasks, etc. \n3 \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n For security contracts – security coverage (e.g. 24 hours) and number of guard posts, \nfrequency of patrols, number of security \nguards and supervisor s, equipment (e.g. \nelectronic probing devices for patrols), \nresponse time to requests for additional \nservice, a supervision plan and records of \nservice, etc. \nContract terms and conditions (e.g. contract \nperiod, payment cond itions, third party \ninsurance, contract termination provisions). \nA warning against bribery and collusion in \nbidding. \nPayment methods (e.g. monthly payments) and \nrates for additional or variation of services (if \npayments and rates are to be proposed by the \nbidders for assessment, this should be stated in \nthe invitation document). \nThe selection criteria and their respective \nweightings in the assessment of tenders or quotations, if price is not the only consideration. \nManagement Appoint a panel of staff to vet and approve the \ntender documents (incl uding the assessment \ncriteria) and, if price is not the only consideration, \nto assess the proposals. \n2.3 Sourcing of Contractors \nProcurement \nStaff Maintaining Approved Contractors Lists \nMaintain a list of contractors approved by the \nmanagement or a designated panel, if exercises for \ncontracting out cleaning and security services are \nfrequently conducted. \n4 \n   \n  \n  \n  \n   \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n                                                \n Ensure that the approved lis t contains an adequate \nnumber of contractors to enhance competitiveness. \nEstablish a procedure for inviting openly contractors \nto apply for listing from time to time. \nLay down the criteria and procedures for listing and \ndelisting, and make them known to all contractors \n(e.g. on the website). \nVet all",
